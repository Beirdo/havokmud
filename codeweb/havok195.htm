<pre>News for March, 28th 2003

Here's the list of the changes that were made for this port. Quite possible
that more got done and we forgot to log it, but this is the brunt of it :)

Zones
Only one zone was ported, Temple of Sin. Why just the one? Because
we have a severe shortage of builders. Interested in building?
Talk to Xenon, email him at natewalk@u.washington.edu or mudmail him.

Bug Fixes
* It's no longer possible to portal, psi_portal or doorway to immortals or
  linkdead players.
* It's no longer possible to summon immortals or linkdead players.
* When asleep, player will no longer notice doors opening and closing.
* Suffering due to undernourishment/poison/etc now shows a message.
* Spell disintegrate can no longer disintegrate equipment outside arena
  when both caster and target are PCs.
* Fixed linkdead on whois.
* It's no longer possible to avoid backstab when paralyzed.
* Dragonbreath no longer affects group members.
* Took off the %filled when looking IN a corpse (it always returned negative).
* Tracking with true sight now works in dark rooms too.
* Spell dispel magic now also gets rid of protection from good, detect good,
  find traps and stoneskin.
* New paladin spells are now dispellable.
* Fixed mind, only works for psi now.
* Goblin chuirgeon now sells lasting points, apologies to those who bought
  in vain.
* Cause serious now shows messages, yay!
* Rangers: When Giant Growth wears off, you now get a message.
* Thieves can now practice remove trap.

Changes</pre>
<pre>* Fighting styles now actually works according to practiced level. A few
  minor changes in what they do.
* Fireshield: now shows it's proper message instead of fireball.
* Fireshield: Armor/Weaponry gets twice as many saves before it gets singed.
* Fireshield: Other items get thrice as many saves before they burn to cinders.
* Spell sunray now scraps ANTI-SUN equipment on targets struck by the spell.
* Practice command is now nicely sorted. By level in guild, alphabetical outside.
* Skill [w m s c t d r p k i a] now works for all classes, listed in
  alphabetical order.
* Monks now get natural +hit on fists:
  lvl  1:  +1
      12:  +2
      20:  +3
      28:  +4
      35:  +5
* Poly mobs can now successfully spy into adjacent rooms.
* When you poly, your prompt and special flags (ansi, etc) come along to your
  new form.
* Prettied up polied char looks in room.
* Prettied up mob looks in room.
* Stats of animal summons are upped a bit.

New Stuff
* Added a guildmaster for sorcerers, about time! Astyathorn is in the sorc
  wing of the Guildhalls.
* By popular request: Legend damage spells &amp; backstab now show damage as well!
* Armor now has an armor size value.. As all old items are set to all sizes, 
  it's not really relevant yet, but will be in the future. The idea is that 
  races have sizes as well, and can only wear a certain size range.
* If you run out of rent but still have coin in the bank, the game will take
  your money out of the bank automatically.
* Added a toggling autointerface: 'autoloot' toggles autoloot enable/diable. 
  Same for autogold, etc.
* Monks get a variety of damage messages, though essentially they all do
  the same: hit, smash, punch, jab, strike
* Items can now have a specific level ego, though the old items are still
  determined by value.
* Made 'bs' a built-in alias for backstab.
* Running now shows dir, regardless of sneak.
* Containers may or may not show fullness, depending on the way it was built.
* Corpses (in roomview) don't show fullness anymore.
