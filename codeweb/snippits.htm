list of code snippits that i made up for Havok. Everything is
mostly all my work. Some stuff may be heavily altered stock code
and some may be the works of other Havoks immortals. I probably
won't put to many things up at first. They have been designed for
DaleMuds but may perhaps be usuable with a bit of alterations to
other muds.</strong></font></p>
