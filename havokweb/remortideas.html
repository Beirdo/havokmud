Ideas for class-specific skills (remort skills)     -Lennya 2003.09.22

Mage		Add chillshield to spell list for remorts? Maybe not. Hmm.
			A mana shield spell? Damage done to char eats up mana (down to 0) before eating hps?
			Make gust of wind lag victim for 2 rounds rather than 1?
			Up their natural mana regen rate (by 10?)
			Brew skill? Brew mage spells into potions.

Cleric		a number of spells:
			group heal (heal all in group)
			power heal (heal twice as much)
			Maybe up the duration of sanctuary and BB by one tick?
			Lower mana costs of healing spells? This could be messy, code wise.
			Scribe skill? Scribe cleric spells into scrolls.

Warrior		mend skill
			Upgrade natural hp regen rate (by 5?)
			.. outta ideas here.

Thief		Innate sneak? Or if that's too pretty.. innate hide?
			Higher backstab bonus than non remorts
			(basically lowering both (god knows it should be done), but remort less than others?)
			poison blade skill? make a weapon envenomed for one hit? Is this useful? May need an orebuild :(

Druid		Make creeping death a remort spell.
			Reincarnate too maybe?
			Add chillshield to spell list for remorts?
			Up their natural mana regen rate (by 10?)

Monk		Flower fist skill? Area attack thingie.
			Up dodge skills compared to plain monk? (maybe lower plain)
			add another +1 to hitroll for each 10 levels gained.
			increase damage by 5%.
			increase attacks a wee bit, to get a standard 5 at lvl 50? Monks get no weaponspeed bonus, or haste.

Barbarian	Add a bit of HP gain per level? Even one each level would be nice.
			Increase damage by 10%? Or +1% for each five levels gained?
			(I'm floundering here. Barbs suck.)
			mend skill? Maybe keep this restricted to warrior.
			Upgrade natural hp regen rate (by 15?)

Ranger		Make a speak with mob skill.. it tells you the whereabouts of it's race brothers in the zone?
			(assuming we tune down haste to add 1.5 attacks, rather than double number)
			Add an extra attack for the dual wielded weapon when hasted?
			Increase damage vs. Undead by 10%.
			Increase damage done to evil by 5%.

Paladin		Increase damage done to evil by 20%.
			Reduce damage done to good by 20%.
			Increase damage vs. Undead by 10%.

Psi			a locate spell akin to scry? If you can scry mobs.. why not objects?
			That r:blunt skill Banon made.. make it psi remort?
			give them innate protection from mind attacks?
			Immune charm, sleep?
			Up natural mana and hp regen rate (by 5 each?)

Bard		Ugh. Just rip em out of the code I say. Buncha bumons.

Necromancer	Increase damage done to good by 15%.
			Increase damage done to neutral by 5%.
			Reduce damage done to evil by 20%.
			Reduce damage done to undead by 10%.
			increase life tap spell effectiveness by 10%?


Some comments:	haste spell:	make it do #attacks = base+1.5 (rather than the current #attacks = base*2)
				SLAY weapons:	make em do +50% damage, rather than +100%.
								basically, this means that a paladin with slay:evil vs an evil undead mob
								does about 1.5*1.2*1.1*damage = 1.98*damage (about what the old slay did)
