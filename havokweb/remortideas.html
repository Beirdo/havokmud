<b>Ideas for class-specific skills (remort skills)		-Lennya 2003.09.22</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Mage</b><br>
Add chillshield to spell list for remorts? Maybe not. Hmm.<br>
A mana shield spell? Damage done to char eats up mana (down to 0) before eating hps?<br>
Make gust of wind lag victim for 2 rounds rather than 1?<br>
Up their natural mana regen rate (by 10?)<br>
Brew skill? Brew mage spells into potions.<br>
<br>
<b>Cleric</b><br>
a number of spells:<br>
group heal (heal all in group)<br>
power heal (heal twice as much)<br>
Maybe up the duration of sanctuary and BB by one tick?<br>
Lower mana costs of healing spells? This could be messy, code wise.<br>
Scribe skill? Scribe cleric spells into scrolls.<br>
<br>
<b>Warrior</b><br>
mend skill<br>
Upgrade natural hp regen rate (by 5?)<br>
.. outta ideas here.<br>
<br>
<b>Thief</b><br>
Innate sneak? Or if that's too pretty.. innate hide?<br>
Higher backstab bonus than non remorts<br>
(basically lowering both (god knows it should be done), but remort less than others?)<br>
poison blade skill? make a weapon envenomed for one hit? Is this useful? May need an orebuild :(<br>
<br>
<b>Druid</b><br>
Make creeping death a remort spell.<br>
Reincarnate too maybe?<br>
Add chillshield to spell list for remorts?<br>
Up their natural mana regen rate (by 10?)<br>
<br>
<b>Monk</b><br>
Flower fist skill? Area attack thingie.<br>
Up dodge skills compared to plain monk? (maybe lower plain)<br>
add another +1 to hitroll for each 10 levels gained.<br>
increase damage by 5%.<br>
increase attacks a wee bit, to get a standard 5 at lvl 50? Monks get no weaponspeed bonus, or haste.<br>
<br>
<b>Barbarian</b><br>
Add a bit of HP gain per level? Even one each level would be nice.<br>
Increase damage by 10%? Or +1% for each five levels gained?<br>
(I'm floundering here. Barbs suck.)<br>
mend skill? Maybe keep this restricted to warrior.<br>
Upgrade natural hp regen rate (by 15?)<br>
<br>
<b>Ranger</b><br>
Make a speak with mob skill.. it tells you the whereabouts of it's race brothers in the zone?<br>
(assuming we tune down haste to add 1.5 attacks, rather than double number)<br>
Add an extra attack for the dual wielded weapon when hasted?<br>
Increase damage vs. Undead by 10%.<br>
Increase damage done to evil by 5%.<br>
<br>
<b>Paladin</b><br>
Increase damage done to evil by 20%.<br>
Reduce damage done to good by 20%.<br>
Increase damage vs. Undead by 10%.<br>
<br>
<b>Psi</b><br>
a locate spell akin to scry? If you can scry mobs.. why not objects?<br>
That r:blunt skill Banon made.. make it psi remort?<br>
give them innate protection from mind attacks?<br>
Immune charm, sleep?<br>
Up natural mana and hp regen rate (by 5 each?)<br>
<br>
<b>Bard</b><br>
Ugh. Just rip em out of the code I say. Buncha bumons.<br>
<br>
<b>Necromancer</b><br>
Increase damage done to good by 15%.<br>
Increase damage done to neutral by 5%.<br>
Reduce damage done to evil by 20%.<br>
Reduce damage done to undead by 10%.<br>
increase life tap spell effectiveness by 10%?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Some comments:</b><br>
<b>haste spell:</b>
make it do #attacks = base+1.5 (rather than the current #attacks = base*2)<br>
<b>SLAY weapons:</b>
make em do +50% damage, rather than +100%.<br>
basically, this means that a paladin with slay:evil vs an evil undead mob<br>
does about 1.5*1.2*1.1*damage = 1.98*damage (about what the old slay did)<br>
