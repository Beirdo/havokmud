            size=2><BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P>Once you have <a href="connectingtohavok.html">connected</a> to 
            Havok, you will be confronted with the login screen, which features 
            ASCII art intended to resemble the main graphic to the left.&nbsp; 
            Creating a character is pretty straight-forward, but serious players 
            will find that there is a lot of information to understand, so we'll 
            go through it step by step.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">What is thy name?<br>
            </font>When you see this question, it is time to come up with a name 
            for your character, if you haven't already.&nbsp; We have a few 
            rules on Havok about player names, which are intended to preserve 
            the fantasy atmosphere for everyone to enjoy. </P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 1: Your name must be compatable 
            with a fantasy setting, but it can be a &quot;real-world&quot; name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 2: No names of famous fantasy characters.&nbsp; 
            This includes characters from mythology as well as more modern ones, 
            so for instance, the names Drizzt and Bilbo are not okay.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 3: It should be a name that someone's (fantasy) 
            mother might actually name their child.</P>
            <P>Once you choose your name, it will ask for a password.&nbsp; 
            Don't forget it.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Would you like to have ansi colors?<br>
            </font>Ansi color codes are how Havok describes colors to your MUD 
            Client.&nbsp; Using colors is highly recommended.&nbsp; Once you're 
            in the game, you can switch back and forth by typing
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>set ansi disable</b></font> or
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>set ansi enable</b></font>.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Havok Character Creation Menu<br>
            </font>The next thing you see will be this:</P>
            <P><img border="0" src="creationmenu.gif" width="359" height="175"></P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Gender<br>
            </font>This is either male or female, obviously.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Race<br>
            </font>All of Havok's player races are described on the
            <a href="../races.html">Races</a> page.&nbsp; That page lists 
            detailed information, including racial bonuses/penalties, which 
            classes/multiclasses each race can engage in, and maximum stats for 
            each.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Class</font><br>
            Every character's gotta have some class.&nbsp; Your character class 
            describes what sort of character you have.&nbsp; To help you choose 
            which class you'd like, our <a href="../classes.html">Classes</a> 
            page describes each of them in detail.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Main Class<br>
            </font>Every character has a main class.&nbsp; If your character has 
            only one class, s/he is called 'single-classed', and her class will 
            be her main class.&nbsp; If your character has two or three classes, 
            s/he is called 'multi-classed', and you'll have to decide which of 
            her classes will be her main class.</P>
            <P>A main class confers certain bonuses to the character.&nbsp; 
            In-game, this is intended to represent special skill in that class, 
            due to your character focusing on it.&nbsp; Each main class offers a 
            different set of bonuses from the others, so choose well.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Character Stats<br>
            </font>There are six different character stats on Havok.&nbsp; They 
            are:</P>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">
            Strength</font>, which determines how much weight you can lift, and 
            how hard you can hit things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">Intelligence</font>, 
            which determines magic-point regeneration rates, as well as how 
            quickly you can learn new spells and skills.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">Wisdom</font>, which 
            determines how many magic-points you get, as well as how many 
            training sessions you get each level.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">Dexterity</font>, 
            which determines how agile and quick your character is.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">Constitution</font>, 
            which determines how healthy your character is, and how many 
            health-points s/he has.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">Charisma</font>, 
            which determines how likable you are.&nbsp; This has an affect on 
            the types of creatures you can summon, and how many, and also how 
            much gold shopkeepers will charge you for their services and goods.</P>
            <P>When you roll your stats, you won't see numbers.&nbsp; You will 
            see a list of little arrows which represent rough levels.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
            most arrows a given attribute can get is 9.</P>
            <P>Also, keep in mind, Havok uses an infinite reroll system, so you 
            can feel free to roll your character as long as you like.</P>
            <P><font color="#33CC99">Alignment<br>
            </font>Every character must choose an alignment.&nbsp; Your 
            character's alignment describes how good or evil s/he is.&nbsp; The 
            alignment you choose is not permenant: it can be changed through 
            your actions in-game.&nbsp; The three alignments are <b>
            <font color="#FFFFFF">Good</font></b>, <b>Neutral</b>, and <b>
            <font color="#FF0000">Evil</font></b>, although some classes are 
            restricted.&nbsp; For instance, Paladins can only be good-aligned, 
            while Necromancers can only be Evil.<br>
