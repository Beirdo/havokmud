              off, for those of you that don’t know what a MUD is, a MUD is a 
              Text Based Multi-User-Dungeon or Dimension where many people from 
              all around the world can play. No software or big expensive programs 
              are needed to play. All you need is a basic Telnet program which 
              most systems come equipped with. But if you truly want the full 
              mudding experience, a MUD client like Zmud, which is available at 
              www.zuggsoft.com, is advisable but that can all be done later after 
              trying it with the standard Telnet program and after deciding if 
              MUD’ing is for you.<br>

              into your Internet browser.<br>
              Upon doing this, a black or white window should appear along with 
              a big Dragon with the words Havok across it. Below that, it should 
              prompt you for a User name. Be Creative now, something Medieval 
              and Unique. No using any D&amp;D names or names such as Bilbo or 
              any other well known name. After confirming your name and your password,

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are in the southern end of the temple 
              hall. The temple has<br>
              been constructed from giant stone blocks, and most of the walls 
              are<br>
              covered by ancient tattered tapestries picturing Gods, Giants and<br>
              peasant. East is the Donation Room, where the temple clothes those<br>
              in need. To the north is the Temple Altar, west leads to the Newbie<br>
              Training area, and the main town of Karsinya is to the south.<br>

              <font color="#00FFFF">Communications</font></b><font color="#00FFFF"><br>
              </font>Now adventuring and slaying evil beast (and some good ones), 
              may be a very essential part of the game but another aspect not 
              to be over looked is the Communications and interaction with the 
              other people in the game. To see who else is playing Havok, type 
              ‘<font color="#FFFF00">who</font>’. Now in order to talk to talk 
              or communication with people, they should be relatively close to 
              you. Type ‘<font color="#FFFF00">whozone</font>’ to see who is
            nearest to you. There is various means of communications throughout Havok.<br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">Say &lt;Text> </font> - This form of communications 
              is room only. Only people in the same room as you will hear you 
              talking<br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">Talk &lt;Person> &lt;Text></font> - This is 
              a means of private communications between 2 people. You can pretty 
              much only talk to people in the same zone as you or to any immortal 
              in the game.<br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">Yell &lt;Text></font> - Yell is used to communication 
              to everyone in the same zone as you. This is probably the best bet 
              to get help if you need it starting off. Just gossip Can I get some 
              help or something to that nature.<br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">Shout &lt;Text> </font> - This is probably 
              the most popular channel, upon shouting, anyone in the world can 
              hear you but you must be level 2 in order to shout. </font></p>
            <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              These are pretty much the 4 essential means of communications. Just 
              a note though, please, no swearing over public channels. We here 
              at HavokMUD try to provide a fun, PG13 type atmosphere for all to 
              enjoy.<br>

              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, if 
              you decided to venture westward from the temple, you’ll be brought 
              to a very simple zone/area for you to explore. You should find some 
              basic enemies that you can battle with. To see how strong they are 
              type ‘<font color="#FFFF00">Consider &lt;Mob Name&gt;</font>’ which 
              should give you a good indication to how strong they are. Now to 
              start your battles, type ‘<font color="#FFFF00">Kill &lt;Mob Name&gt;</font>’. 
              After slaying the beast or monster, you should obtain some experience 
              that goes towards gaining another level. To see how much more experience 
              you need to level or any other basic stat, type ‘<font color="#FFFF00">Score</font>’.&nbsp;<br>
              </font></p>
            <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also 
              after finishing off your foe, his corpse and equipment he was using 
              is up for grabs. To see what he has, type ‘Examine corpse or look 
              in corpse’. If anything catches your eye in the corpse, type ‘Get 
              &lt;item> corpse or get all corpse’.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
              finishing off this zone, you should have enough experience to gain 
              a level, which will make you stronger. You must find your guild 
              master though in order to obtain your level. The guild masters are 
              normally in the guild master’s row, which is located south, east, 
              east, 4 north and westwardly. Before going west, please note that 
              this is the Meeting Place where many people congest together and 
              talk. Also note that the innkeeper is located east and up from here 
              where everyone must go to <font color="#FFFF00"> RENT</font> once 
              they would like to leave. They will keep your equipment and character 
              nice and safe from thieves and such.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
              once you find the correct guildmaster, type ‘<font color="#FFFF00">Gain</font>’ 
              to obtain your new level. You can also practice new skills and spells 
              from this guy. Type ‘<font color="#FFFF00">Practice</font>’ to see 
              this list and ‘<font color="#FFFF00">Practice &lt;skill or spell&gt;</font>’ 
              to learn it.<br>

              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, 
              this should give you enough knowledge to get you rolling and playing. 
              Play around with the ‘<font color="#FFFF00">Help</font>’ command 
              to learn more of Havok’s commands and options. There should also 
              be lots of people around to help you so just ask around and stick 
              with it. MUDs are a very fun and addictive game so have fun and
