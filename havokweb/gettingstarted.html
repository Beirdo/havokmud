            face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>First off, for those of
            you that don’t know what a MUD is, a MUD is a Text Based
            Multi-User-Dungeon or Dimension where many people from all around
            the world can play. No software or big expensive programs are needed
            to play. All you need is a basic Telnet program which most systems
            come equipped with. But if you truly want the full mudding
            experience, a MUD client like Zmud, which is available at
            www.zuggsoft.com, is advisable but that can all be done later after
            trying it with the standard Telnet program and after deciding if
            MUD’ing is for you.<BR><BR><B><BR></B></FONT><B><FONT

            you can move to other rooms by typing the direction name (<FONT

            equipment and items are, go north into the hall of rules or finally,

            ancient tattered tapestries picturing Gods, Giants and<BR>peasant.
            East is the Donation Room, where the temple clothes those<BR>in

            color=#00ffff><BR></FONT>Now adventuring and slaying evil beast (and
            some good ones), may be a very essential part of the game but
            another aspect not to be over looked is the Communications and
            interaction with the other people in the game. To see who else is
            playing Havok, type ‘<FONT color=#ffff00>who</FONT>’. Now in order
            to talk to talk or communication with people, they should be
            relatively close to you. Type ‘<FONT color=#ffff00>whozone</FONT>’
            to see who is nearest to you. There is various means of
            communications throughout Havok.<BR><FONT color=#ffff00>Say
            &lt;Text&gt; </FONT>- This form of communications is room only. Only
            people in the same room as you will hear you talking<BR><FONT
            color=#ffff00>Talk &lt;Person&gt; &lt;Text&gt;</FONT> - This is a
            means of private communications between 2 people. You can pretty
            much only talk to people in the same zone as you or to any immortal
            in the game.<BR><FONT color=#ffff00>Yell &lt;Text&gt;</FONT> - Yell
            is used to communication to everyone in the same zone as you. This
            is probably the best bet to get help if you need it starting off.
            Just gossip Can I get some help or something to that
            nature.<BR><FONT color=#ffff00>Shout &lt;Text&gt; </FONT>- This is
            probably the most popular channel, upon shouting, anyone in the
            world can hear you but you must be level 2 in order to shout.

            <P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
            size=2><BR>These are pretty much the 4 essential means of
            communications. Just a note though, please, no swearing over public
            channels. We here at HavokMUD try to provide a fun, PG13 type
            atmosphere for all to enjoy.<BR><BR></FONT></P>

            size=2>Now, if you decided to venture westward from the temple,
            you’ll be brought to a very simple zone/area for you to explore. You
            should find some basic enemies that you can battle with. To see how
            strong they are type ‘<FONT color=#ffff00>Consider &lt;Mob
            Name&gt;</FONT>’ which should give you a good indication to how
            strong they are. Now to start your battles, type ‘<FONT
            color=#ffff00>Kill &lt;Mob Name&gt;</FONT>’. After slaying the beast
            or monster, you should obtain some experience that goes towards
            gaining another level. To see how much more experience you need to
            level or any other basic stat, type ‘<FONT
            color=#ffff00>Score</FONT>’.&nbsp;<BR></FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Also
            after finishing off your foe, his corpse and equipment he was using
            is up for grabs. To see what he has, type ‘Examine corpse or look in
            corpse’. If anything catches your eye in the corpse, type ‘Get
            &lt;item&gt; corpse or get all corpse’.<BR></FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>After
            finishing off this zone, you should have enough experience to gain a
            level, which will make you stronger. You must find your guild master
            though in order to obtain your level. The guild masters are normally
            in the guild master’s row, which is located south, east, east, 4
            north and westwardly. Before going west, please note that this is
            the Meeting Place where many people congest together and talk. Also
            note that the innkeeper is located east and up from here where
            everyone must go to <FONT color=#ffff00>RENT</FONT> once they would
            like to leave. They will keep your equipment and character nice and
            safe from thieves and such.<BR></FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Now
            once you find the correct guildmaster, type ‘<FONT
            color=#ffff00>Gain</FONT>’ to obtain your new level. You can also
            practice new skills and spells from this guy. Type ‘<FONT
            color=#ffff00>Practice</FONT>’ to see this list and ‘<FONT
            color=#ffff00>Practice &lt;skill or spell&gt;</FONT>’ to learn

            size=2><BR></FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
            size=2>Anyway, this should give you enough knowledge to get you
            rolling and playing. Play around with the ‘<FONT

            and options. There should also be lots of people around to help you
