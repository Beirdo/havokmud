<pre>[News for November 2, 2003]

Here's a listing of most of the stuff that's happened for this port. Doubtless there's
some missing.  If you find anything not list, by all means.. Inform us.. :) Big super
thanks to Lennya, Banon, Gordon, Sentinel and Rocky!
[Zones]
Coming soon!!
[Bug Fixes]
* Default race on char generation is now human.
* It's no longer possible to gain lvl 51 at GMs.
* Fixed set groupname. Mind you, now you gotta 'set groupname', not 'set group name'.
* Haste when mounted now works.
* Reinc and Resurrect also restores leaderxp loss. Death counts should not increase.
* Got rid of the 0 xp mobs. But this may mean some low level mobs have mad xps now.
  If you find one, let us know.
* Spec Damage is no longer called in spelldamage, only in plain hack and slash.
* Victims of chain lightning now get the save they're entitled to.
* Finally fixed the dispel-darkness-no-message thing. Sorry for taking so
 long.
* 'Resist' command shows the proper status. See below in Changes too.
* The Frost Breath crash bug should now be corrected. Feel free to get some frosty breaths
  aimed at you. Lemme hear.
* Wild elves can no longer choose paladin or monk for a class. Thanks to Luna for spotting.
* Fixed the ONLY-CLASS flag. Example:
  An item is ANTI-MAGE ANTI-WARRIOR ANTI-THIEF ONLY-CLASS.
  It can be worn by wa, th, mu, wa/th, mu/wa, mu/th, mu/wa/th. Not by cl/wa/th.
* Fixed some problems with forcerent and rare item removal
</pre>
<pre>[Changes]
* Autotitles have been fully revised, thanks to Rocky.
* Added a level check for ethereal posts. To enter the Ethereal Plane, 'touch post'.
* Objects can be INSTRUMENT, lowering 'play' mana cost, and are required for most bard songs.
* Made an impale damage type (for paladin lances) and a blast damage type (the old school blunt).
* Remove command now works with abbreviations of item names too: 'rem leg' to remove leggings.
* Made learning a bit easier for fighting styles.
* To make up for the saves vs chain lightning, damage has been upped from d6 to d8.
* Susceptibility now cancels out Resistance to a damage type, and vice versa.
* If monk dodge is successful, there's no subsequent miss message. Dodge message should be clear enough.
* Implemented blade barrier as a lvl 45 cleric skill, replacing fireshield.
* Mage mobs &gt; 39 will cast fireshield, and are less monsum-oriented. Can portal to hatees too!
* Cleric mobs &gt; 44 will cast blade barrier. Beware. Hurts.
* Thieves without a warrior class will now go up to 1.6 (base) attacks a round.
* Identify is now a level 10 mage/sorc spell, a level 16 cleric spell.
  It has now a 2 round lag, no stun. 15 mana.
* Stone skin now costs 40 mana.
* Cleaned out some unnecessary autosplit messages.
    You get A golden coin from ... There was 1 coins ... Just keep it all.
  First line should suffice there.
* Slow and haste spells now work on mobiles as well as players. Mage mobs don't haste themselves as yet.
* Changed troll regen so it is more useful.
* Sleep spell should now make the victim and caster stop fighting when cast durring combat.
* Fixed Psi Shield, Psi can now learn and use it.
* New threated message board. (compliments of Ixion)
* New page printer. (Pause, page, quit, etc)
</pre>
<pre>[New Stuff]
* Necromancer class, with lots of cool spells and skills. Gotta stay evil tough!
* Implemented blade barrier as a lvl 45 cleric skill, replacing fireshield.
* Many new procs, most of which aren't to be enjoyed yet.
  Ashamael's Tarantis, Sentinel's zone, King's Grove.
* Tweaking implemented. This is a rather peculiar function. It causes items to not always load with
  their regular stats. If an item has a tweak rate, chance may cause it to tweak, either good or
  bad. Tweaking is subject to some regulations. Remind me to post more info on the board.
* Tons of spell descriptions added by Sentinel (look sentinel -&gt; Sentinel looks rather fishy!).
* Auction code. You can now 'auction' items, and 'bid' on items. May get the economy going with
  the existence of tweaked items.
* More colors have seen a drastic review. However, for those that prefer the old look, there's a
  'set oldcolor enable' option. New colors now apply to score, attributes, identify, resist, stat.
* Monks get an additional +1 to HITROLL for every seven levels they've attained, with a max of
  +7 at level 50. Naked monks should have more use now.
* Added some new bard skills...play, stop, weave
* Level 53 Immortals now have a reimbursement command which restores a player to status as he/she
  last rented.

[Closing Notes]
Well, things have been quiet lately so we all decided to port the latest code additions.
Our original plan was to wait until we finished a few more zones and projects but after
a few months of being stale, we decided to port what we have .. work out some of the bugs
and build our playerbase back up some.  We'll see how it goes.
Anyway, if you have any problems at all, please come find me, Lennya, or Gordon and we'll
gladly help you, Have fun and don't forget.. Tell your friends.. ;)
Banon and the Imp council.
