Guide</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>By Greg Hovey</strong></font></p>

<p align="left">Here are all the necessary steps to get anyone
set up and ready to code for Havok. If you have any questions or
comments, feel free to email me at <a
href="mailto:hoveyg@hotmail.com">hoveyg@hotmail.com</a> or find
me on ICQ.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step One:</u></strong> Goto <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</a> and download and
installs its latest version of cygwin. Special note: Make sure
you have the GCC, CRYPT, MAKE, CVS, OpenSSH packages along with
its regular base system.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Two:</u></strong> Go to <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.com">www.sourceforge.com</a> and
create an account there and get myself to add you to our project.
If your waiting for me to add you to our project developer list,
skip the next few steps for now and follow step #5 and #6. If
your doing this for your own personal use and don't plan on
contributing to Havok or plan on making your own mud, then you
can skip a few of these steps and checkout the mud as an anonymous user but you'll have to read up on the
source forge web page to
figure that out.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Three:</u></strong> In Cygwin, type '<strong>export
CVS_RSH=ssh</strong>' and '<strong>export
CVSROOT=(YourSourceforgeUserName)@cvs.havok.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/havok</strong>'.
After this is completed, you should be able to obtain the latest
version of Havok by typing '<strong>cvs checkout havokmud</strong>'
in a Cygwin Shell and then it will prompt you for your source forge password. </p>

<p><strong><u>Step Four:</u></strong> After all the Havok files
have been downloaded to your computer, you should now be able to
change the directory to <strong>havokmud</strong> and type '<strong>make
-f makefile.w32</strong>' to compile the mud.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Five:</u></strong><strong> </strong>The mud
may be compiled though but at the minute you have no library files
to accompany the mud. So the best method to obtain these is to
download the latest tar ball on Source Forge or click <a href="http://havok.haaksman.org/~banon/lib.tar.gz">here</a>
to download an old lib that I was testing stuff on.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Six:</u></strong> Now you should have
everything you need to run the mud. You can run the mud by typing
'<strong>./dmserver -d (/LibDirectoryLocation/) (port#)</strong>'.
I normally just type<strong> './dmserver -d ./lib/</strong>'
which will default to port 4000.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Seven:</u></strong> Now that its running, you
can now connect to the mud by telnet/connecting to the address
'localhost' on what ever port you opened up on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="5"><u>Steps to Editing and Committing your changes</u></font></p>

<p><strong><u>Step One:</u></strong> The first step is to
download a good editor to alter and change your code. I
personally use Text Pad v4.5 because of its easy to use find
utility which will find any string in all your source code and
because of its language color parsing abilities which makes it
easier to find mistakes and analyze your code. (Download <a
href="http://download.textpad.com/download/files/txpeng450.exe">TextPad</a>)</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Two:</u></strong> Ok.. this is the tricky
part..... Code something... </p>

<p><strong><u>Step Three:</u></strong> After altering your code.
You should always compile the code and make sure that it works
and that there is no bugs or problems with it because you should
never commit changes that are messed up because then when the
other coders for the mud update there new release, they will have
your messed up code and wont' have a clue what's going on.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Four:</u></strong> After all is perfect, its
usually a good idea to update your code to the latest version of
the source just to sync your code with the other coders new code
that they committed since you last updated or committed yourself.
This can be done in the cygwin shell by typing '<strong>cvs
update</strong>' in the havokmud directory. This will merge your
changes with the master copy of Havok in the sourceforge
database.</p>

<p><strong><u>Step Five:</u></strong> Type 'cvs commit' to commit
all your changes. After comparing the source forge version and
your version, it'll then ask you to type in comments to describe
your additions to the mud. If it says there is no editor
pressent, type '<strong>export EDITOR=vi</strong>' or whatever
editor your use too. Few notes about VI, to start editing, type<strong>
i </strong>to insert and type in your description. After your
done, press <strong>&lt;ESCAPE&gt;</strong> and they type '<strong>!wq</strong>'
to quit and save your changes to the log. <i>New: a short cut of doing this is
to just type 'cvs commit -m 'describe your changes'</i></p>

<p><strong><u>Step Six:</u></strong> There really is no step six
so that's basically it. You have just successfully committed and
contributed your own additions to Havok. If you have any
questions or comments or if something doesn't' work. Feel free to
email me at <a href="mailto:hoveyg@hotmail.com">hoveyg@hotmail.com</a>
or find me on Havok or ICQ.</p>
