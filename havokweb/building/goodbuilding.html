            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of what it takes to do some
            really good building is to take advantage of those things I
            mentioned in Chapter V.&nbsp; But – a good chunk of it comes from
            something that no online editor can ever emulate, and that’s good
            ol’ fashioned Human Creativity.&nbsp; Building is a creative activity.&nbsp;
            It requires imagination, dedication, and vision.&nbsp; Hopefully, that
            last sentence describes you to a T.&nbsp; If not, don’t fear, in this
            chapter, I hope to give to a running start on the path to making it
            LOOK like you’re imaginitive and creative, which often times is
            really just as good.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s start at the beginning.&nbsp; A
            good zone is almost ALWAYS the product of a plan.&nbsp; That is, the
            builder sat down and mapped out the zone on paper, wrote down ideas
            for various rooms and mobs, came up with a background story for the
            zone to explain what’s going on in it, and after it was all sorted
            out, sat down to build it.&nbsp; This isn’t always the way it has to be
            done, but trust me, especially if you’re working on your first zone
            or second, you will give yourself a huge advantage towards
            successfully completing a marvelous zone if you take the time to do
            these.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>Tip 1: Map out your
            zone</b> <b>on paper.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can’t stress enough how important
            this is, especially to newer builders.&nbsp; After you’ve finished a few
            zones, you’ll probably have the practice it takes to keep the full
            idea of a zone in your head over the length of the building
            project.&nbsp; A map – even just a sketched out one that doesn’t
            necessarily account for every room, but rather just highlights the
            important parts – is essential.&nbsp; When you get to those moments when
            you’re just sitting and staring dumbly at the screen (we all have
            them), you can look down at your map and ask, “Okay, what haven’t I
            done yet?&nbsp; Let’s do that.”&nbsp; A map can not only help you to keep
            track of the ultimate end of the zone, but it can give you a
            reference from which to figure out what to do next when you get
            stumped.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>Tip 2: Make notes on
            your map.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">Keep in mind – a good
            zone will often take a month or two to complete.&nbsp; If you don’t write
            down your ideas, you’re in high danger of forgetting them before
            they make it into the game.&nbsp; We all want to see what you come up
            with, so please, write them down so you can remember to put them
            in.&nbsp; Writing things on your map such as mob locations, or notes on
            what a room might contain, can provide you with material to add in
            to the room desc when you get to building that room.&nbsp; It will help
            you to create more unique and descriptive room descs, which is the
            name of the game.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>Tip 3: Visualize your
            room!</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many builders run into the age-old
            problem where it seems like they’re writing the same descriptions
            over and over and over.&nbsp; (Special note: DO NOT use the same room
            desc for multiple rooms.&nbsp; If you find yourself wanting to do this,
            ask yourself why you need several rooms to describe this one place
            which is apparently uniform in appearance.&nbsp; No places in the real
            world would ever have the same descs over and over, so don’t do it
            here.)&nbsp; Visualizing your room is the best way to create unique and
            interesting room descs.&nbsp; Close your eyes and imagine yourself in
            this room.&nbsp; Stand in it for a little bit, and take mental notes.&nbsp;
            When you get back to the real world (Havok, of course), write down
            what you saw.&nbsp; Imaginations are a wonderful thing.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>Tip 4: Some ideas for
            what to write:</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are NOT supposed to be a
            checklist by any means.&nbsp; Instead, use this list as a reference if
            you get stuck, or if you’re having a hard time visualizing or even
            imagining the rooms you’re working on.&nbsp; Use these as a starting
            point to get the ball rolling, and then go from there.</p>
