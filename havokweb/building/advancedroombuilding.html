            Room Building</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so you’re a master of the
            exit, and the sector type, and the room description.&nbsp; At this point,
            there should be nothing holding you back from creating very nice,
            tasteful rooms (assuming your English is good and you’ve got a
            healthy creative streak – if not, don’t sweat it, nothing is
            impassable).</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this chapter is about the
            things that aren’t obvious, that only jump out to the player who
            really looks into the world he’s playing with – in short, this
            chapter is about how to impress the type of people worth
            impressing.&nbsp; Just because this chapter is advanced doesn’t mean you
            should skip it.&nbsp; I fully expect every zone to live up to it’s
            greatest potential, no matter if it’s your first or fiftieth zone.&nbsp;
            But don’t go mad trying to cram everything you find in this chapter
            into every one of your zones – these things are here to make your
            zones come to life, not to stifle them.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everything in this chapter is
            necessarily easy to understand, although I’ve done the best I can to
            make it easy to follow.&nbsp; That’s why it’s advanced.&nbsp; Try your best,
            though, the tricks in here are what really make a zone shine.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>V.2: Extra
            Descriptions</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extra descs are a must for any good
            zone.&nbsp; There are lots of pretty decent zones out there that have
            none at all, but all of them could be improved by adding a few
            interesting extras.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An extra desc is when you try to
            look at something in a room – usually something mentioned in the
            room desc – and the mud has something to tell you about it.&nbsp; For
            instance:</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This room is tall, with a steep,
            conical, wooden-beamed ceiling.&nbsp; The beams are carved through
            in staggering detail, and inlaid with silver, which shines brightly
            against the deep color of the wood.</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0033FF">Player</font>:
            <i>exa beams</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0033FF">Havok</font>:<i>
            The beams stretch from the floor, up along the walls, and&nbsp;all the
            way up the ceiling, where they meet at the peak.&nbsp; They are marked
            with silver-inlaid carvings.</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><font color="#0033FF">Player</font>:
            <i>exa markings</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0033FF">Havok</font>:
            <i>The markings are carved into the rich wood of the beams, and were
            finished with silver.&nbsp; Most of the carvings are geometric&nbsp;paterns,
            or leafy stems entwining with one another, but each beam&nbsp;also has
            one letter inscribed on it.</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><font color="#0033FF">Player</font>:
            <i>exa carvings</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0033FF">Havok</font>:
            <i>The markings are carved into the rich wood of the beams,&nbsp;and were
            finished with silver.&nbsp; Most of the carvings are geometric&nbsp;paterns,
            or leafy stems entwining with one another, but each beam&nbsp;also has
            one letter inscribed on it.</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0033FF">Player</font>:
            <i>exa letter</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0033FF">Havok</font>:
            <i>The letters, going clockwise around the room, spell
            out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S-O-U-T-H</i> <i>in the common tongue.</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><font color="#0033FF">Player</font>:
            <i>exa south</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><font color="#0033FF">Havok</font>:
            <i>There seems to be a secret exit embedded in the south wall.</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><font color="#0033FF">Player</font>:
            <i>open door south</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0033FF">Havok</font>:
            <i>You open the door.</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Okay, maybe I got a bit carried away with that
            one.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; But you can see what an interesting bit of
            flesh extra descs can add to a room.&nbsp; You’ll note that when the
            player typed <font color="#FFFF00"><b>exa markings</b></font>, he
            got the same response as he got for <font color="#FFFF00"><b>exa
            carvings</b></font>.&nbsp; You can set this up with a single extra desc.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create an extra description,
            type <font color="#FFFF00"><b>edit extra (keyword/s)</b></font>.&nbsp;
            You’ll be prompted for the text.&nbsp; Go all out with your extras.&nbsp; As a
            player, there are few things more rewarding (other than finding some
            awesome loot) than taking the time to look around a room and
            actually finding something there.&nbsp; Is every player going to take the
            time to look around?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But some will – and those players will be
            impressed and pleased with your building, and in the end, that’s
            what matters.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make markings/carvings extra
            that I had in the example, I would type <font color="#FFFF00"><b>
            edit extra mark marks marking markings carving carvings</b></font>.&nbsp;
            By doing that, any of those keywords would bring up the extra desc
            about the markings.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should note that it is not
            necessary to embed so many extra descs in a single room, nor is it
            necessary to hide secrets in them.&nbsp; Extra descs are nice just in
            their own right.&nbsp; I would say that you’re doing a very good job if
            every room has one extra desc, pertaining to the most
            pertinent/interesting feature of the room.&nbsp; If every single thing
            mentioned in your roomdesc has an extra desc for it, you’re a madman
            (I mean that in a good way), and your zone’s gonna come out
            absolutely awesome.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>V.3: Exit Descriptions</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I mentioned exit
            descriptions in <font color="#33CC99">Chapter IV.5</font>, so I’ll
            just bring it up briefly here.&nbsp; They’re very nice.&nbsp; Don’t forget
            about them.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>V.4: Flowing Rivers</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make a river that flows – that
            is, that will carry a player downstream from room to room – use
            <font color="#FFFF00"><b>redit</b></font> to set the sector type to
            #<font color="#FFFF00"><b>8</b></font>, <font color="#FFFF00">Water
            NoSwim</font>.&nbsp; It’ll ask you for speed and direction.&nbsp; The speed
            must be a multiple of 15.&nbsp; 15 is fastest, 90 is pretty slow.&nbsp; You
            can set it to 0 if you don’t want it to flow.&nbsp; The direction is – as
            always – 012345 (neswud)</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the sector type is set, you
            can use <font color="#FFFF00"><b>edit riv (speed) (dir)</b></font>
            to quickly play with the settings.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>V.5: Teleport Rooms</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A teleport room is one where the
            player/s standing in it will occasionally be teleported to another
            room.&nbsp; There are a few interesting things you can do with this.&nbsp; To
            make a teleport room, use <font color="#FFFF00"><b>edit tele (time)
            (to-room) (lookflag)</b></font>.&nbsp; <b><font color="#FFFF00">Time</font>
            </b>must be a multiple of 10 – 10 is fast, 60 is not fast.&nbsp;
            <font color="#FFFF00"><b>To-room</b></font> is the vnum of the room
            the players should be teleported to.&nbsp; <b><font color="#FFFF00">
            Lookflag</font> </b>should be either <font color="#FFFF00"><b>0</b></font>
            (that’s zero), or any other number.&nbsp; If it’s 0, then the players
            won’t know they’ve been teleported, unless they
            <font color="#FFFF00"><b>look</b></font>.&nbsp; If the lookflag is any
            number other than 0, the players will be forced to look, as if they
            had just walked into the room.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><b>Note:</b></font>
            You should have a very good reason to use a 0 lookflag.&nbsp; If
            something drastic is changing around the players, they will notice,
            and there’s no reason for them not to.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are examples of teleport
            rooms all over Havok.&nbsp; The first two that come to mind are at the
            end of the Curse, and at the end of Cthol.&nbsp; There are many others,
            however, and if you’re creative enough, you can come up with lots of
            ways – not all of them necessarily the way teleports are usually
            used – to come up with some very interesting features of a zone.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>V.6: Tunnel Rooms (AKA
            “small rooms”)</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some rooms have limits on how many
            players and mobs can be in the room at once.&nbsp; These are called
            “tunnel rooms”, although they don’t necessarily have to be a
            tunnel.&nbsp; To make a room like this, use <font color="#FFFF00"><b>edit
            tunn (# of mobs/players)</b></font>.&nbsp; The command will automatically
            set the ‘tunnel’ room flag, which is necessary.&nbsp; Note that the max
            number you allow the room counts both players and mobs, so if you
            have, for instance, a room with a moblimit of 3, and you have 3 mobs
            that load in that room, most players won’t be able to get into it.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example of tunnel rooms is
            in the Abyss, where you have to run down past those freaky demons,
            and the merideths always clog up the works.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>V.7: Tricky Exits</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are lots of tricky things you
            can do with exits, but you should always be careful that the things
            you do with them enhance the zone, instead of taking away from it.&nbsp;
            For example, you can make an exit that leads into a room, but that
            has no exit leading back.&nbsp; I can think of any number of good reasons
            why you might want to do this, but you should always make sure that
            there IS a good reason.&nbsp; Remember – you’re trying to make the game
            fun, not annoying.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#33CC99"><b>V.8: Um………</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s hard to think of all the
            tricky little neat things you might want to do with your zone, and I
            know for a fact that I’m forgetting some, so this section exists
            soley so that I can say “I reserve the right to add more cool nifty
            little things you can do”.</p>
