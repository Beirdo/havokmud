            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HavokMUD has a 
            various number of playable Classes.&nbsp; Most of these classes can also 
            be paired together to play dual- and tri-classes but are obviously 
            much harder to play.&nbsp; New Players to the mud should stick to single 
            classes and work their way up.</font></P>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note that the 
            minimum stats listed are NOT requirements - they are recommendations 
            we make that will make your character better able to deal with what 
            s/he needs.</font></P>

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mages are the 
            class that uses powerful and violent magic, but the magic user does 
            not control nature, and can therefore not bless and such.&nbsp;<br>

            </font><font color="#008080">Minimum Wisdom:</font> 9<br>
            Clerics have the wisdom and blessings of the Gods required to 
            perform Blessings and Healings, although many of them also learn 
            more violent spells.</P>

            </font><font color="#008080">Minimum Strength:</font> 9<br>
            Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.&nbsp; 
            This makes them better at hand-to-hand combat, as they possess 
            skills of violence and fighting unequaled by the members of any 
            other class.&nbsp; However, they lack the ability to use magic of 
            any sort.</P>

            Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other 
            class offers.&nbsp; Many of these qualities can come in handy in 
            many situations, such as picking locks.&nbsp; They are not very 
            combat oriented, however, so do not expect to be able to kill many 
            things by yourself.&nbsp; The useful aspect of thieves involves 
            their ability to scout ahead, avoid monsters, detect and remove 
            traps, and work in the black market.</P>

            good standings (align must be 350+).<br>
            <br>
            Paladins have an innate ability to detect evil and have protection 
            from evil.&nbsp; They also have some special skills that they and 
            only they can use.</P>

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rangers are 
            warriors of the woods. They are expert trackers and learn the ways 
            to best protect and live in a woodland environment. A Ranger's 
            alignment must never become evil (below -350).<br>
            <br>
            Rangers have semi-Cleric/Druid abilities. As the Ranger progresses 
            s/he can learn specific spells that have to do with forest/animal 
            training. To use the spells you use the <font color="#FFFF00">cast</font> 
            command.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Most skills that a Ranger uses must be used OUTSIDE. OUTSIDE is 
            considered in a forest, desert, artic or anywhere not inside.</font></P>

            Druids are spell casters who are in tune with the balance of nature.&nbsp; 
            They have several Cleric-like spells, a few Mage-like spells, and 
            many spells unique to the class.&nbsp; A Druid's alignment must 
            always be neutral (between 350 and -350)</P>

            Barbarians are big brutes who cannot use ANY magical items.&nbsp; 
            They are very similar to the Warrior class, but they have higher 
            hit-point bonuses.&nbsp; One of the defining characteristics of 
            Barbarians is that they are frenzied fighters.</P>

            themselves, but with nature, giving them some advantages in fighting 
            and, over time,&nbsp; skills which reflect this harmony. Furthermore, at 
            very high levels, Monks develop natural resistances to certain 
            sources of damage. Monks don't generally use weapons or shields, for 
            they hit harder with there bare hands.<br>
