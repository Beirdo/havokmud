Havokmud is a MUD that was originally an offshoot of DaleMUD, making it a 
decendant of DikuMUD.

For various reasons, we have decided that we no longer wish to use a Diku
license, but to do this requires that the code no longer be a derivative of 
DikuMUD.  For this reason, to relicense as GPL, we have undertaken the 
gargantuan task of completely rewriting this code-base.  The goal is to have
no Diku-derivative code remaining.

In the process, several more modern features are being implemented:
- multi-threaded design rather than monolithic
- MySQL data backend rather than flat files and binary files
- shared-library plugins for classes, races and zones
- account-based play with multiple PCs per account
- email validation of accounts
- web-based management rather than in-mud zone creation
- custom memory allocation mechanism to minimize system resource use

The initial MUD design is to be based on Dungeons & Dragons, 4th Edition (d20)
for simplicity.

The directory structure will change over time as the code is more perfected.
