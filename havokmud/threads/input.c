 * @brief Thread to handle the input from the sockets, feed to consumers
 * @param arg unused
 * @return never returns until shutdown
 *
 * This thread takes the raw input from the Connection thread, and creates a
 * buffer.  It then feeds the input line by line to the consuming threads which
 * include LoginThread, EditorThread, etc.  This allows for multiple lines or
 * partial lines to be recieved by the network socket.
 *
 * The consuming threads all have a queue to feed it input.  The Input thread
 * doesn't know which thread it's feeding, it just uses the handlingQ that has
 * been registered in the player's structure.  On a new connection, the 
 * handlingQ is set to feed the LoginThread.
