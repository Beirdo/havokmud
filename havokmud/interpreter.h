"\n\r\
You have chosen the magic user class, there are two types of mages here at\n\r\
Havok. The Standard Mage uses mana for his power, the Sorcerer uses his\n\r\
memorization for his powers. Sorcerer's will sit and memorize a spell of thier\n\r\
choice and then after doing so can 'recall' this spell. Sorcerer's are said\n\r\
to be weaker at lower levels than most classes, but after they attain higher\n\r\
experince they can become one of the most powerful.\n\r\
\n\r\n\r\
Enter 'yes' if you want to be a Sorcerer type of mage, hit return if you\n\r\
do not want to be a Sorcerer (yes/no) :"

#define NEWBIE_NOTE \
"\n\r\
 Welcome to Havok, here are a few instructions to help you get\n\r\
 along better at Havok.\n\r\n\r\
 1) We try to get people to role play, but we do not force you. If you enjoy\n\r\
    role playing please do so, if you do not please do not interfer with those\n\r\
    that do.\n\r\
 2) Newbie commands are HELP , NEWS and COMMANDS. Use help for solving most\n\r\
    of your questions. If you still confused ask about.\n\r\
 3) PLEASE do not curse over public channels. This means GOSSIP,SHOUT,AUCTION.\n\r\
    Punishment for doing so begins with removing your ability to use public\n\r\
    channels.\n\r\
 4) Not all public channels work WORLD WIDE. GOSSIP and AUCTION and TELL\n\r\
    only work in the zone your in. There are special spells and skills to\n\r\
    communicate world wide if you need them. SHOUT is WORLD WIDE but it does\n\r\
    cost you MANA and VITIALITY points.\n\r\
 5) Please do not use 'funny' or 'wacky' names. We try to encourage role-playing\n\r\
    and if you use those type of names it does not help matters. If your name\n\r\
    is a name that is used in the Forgotten Realms setting (such as Elminster,\n\r\
    Drizzit etc..) please change it. There are NPC's that use these names and it\n\r\
    will cause confusion. If you do not abide by these rules an immortal might\n\r\
    ask you to change your name.\n\r\
 6) Remember that we try to add a bit of realizem (not to much though:)\n\r\
    and things such as starving to death or dieing of thirst CAN happen.\n\r\
\n\r\n\r"
