INSERT INTO `helpTopics` VALUES (1, 'CLASS LIST', '\n    There are currently 12 classes available, each can be viewed in\n    detail with help class <classname>:\n\n    Barbarian - This is a berserker, the classic bloodlust warrior\n    with a distrust of magic.  Tends to be very hardy, and can\n    truly annihilate opponents when they go berserk.\n\n    Cleric - This is a follower of the gods, who can pray to them\n    for powers and spells.  Typically the magic the gods grant is\n    of the healing and protection variety.\n\n    Druid - This is the guardian of nature.  Not taking the side\n    of good nor evil, they can use the powers of nature to protect\n    themselves and the world around them.  They have no love for\n    man made things, preferring wood and leather.\n\n    Mage - This is a practitioner of the magical arts.  By manipulating\n    the fabric of the energy of the world, they can make unnatural\n    feats occur regularly.  They effects they create tend to be very\n    grandiose and very damaging, typically the opposite of the clerics.\n\n    Monk - This is the consummate fighter, who believes that the human\n    body and mind are the greatest weapons every created.  Martial\n    arts doesn\'t begin to describe the incredible damage that these\n    masters of combat can wreak on opponents.  They are not as hardy\n    as your typical armor wearing, sword swinging warrior.\n\n    Necromancer - This is the death worshipping magic user.  Essentially\n    the opposite of a paladin in every respect.  This mage has great\n    powers over the life force of individuals, draining it with ease,\n    and crafting undead servants from the corpses of his fallen opponents.\n    However, if the necromancer ever drifts into doing good deeds, he or\n    she will lose the powers that make the necromancer so powerful.\n\n    Paladin - This is the epitome of righteousness and virtue.  The\n    paladin is the holy warrior who fights for the good people of\n    the realm.  They can never slip and fall into the darkness of\n    evil deeds, or they will no longer be a paladin.  The paladin\'s\n    purity gives him or her powers that other warriors lack.  In\n    almost all respects they are the necromancers opposites, one\n    worships life and goodness and martial prowess, the other\n    believes in death, magic and evil.\n\n    Psionist - This is the other side of the coin of the monk class.\n    Where the monk achieves discipline of the body, the psionist\n    achieves discipline of the mind.  The psionist has powers that\n    usually attack the mind of opponents, and also specializes in\n    transportation about the realm.  While they are similar to\n    normal mages, the source of their power is different, thus\n    the psionist can do things that mages are incapable of.\n\n    Ranger - This is the blend between a straight fighter and the\n    druidic guardians of nature.  The ranger tends to represent\n    the positive forces of man and nature, if they ever turn to\n    evil, they become normal warriors, losing the benefits of\n    being a ranger.  The ranger gets a few extra skills which are\n    usually nature based, and is the only class which can wield\n    two weapons at once.\n\n    Sorcerer - This is a variant on the mage class.  Where a mage\n    usually uses his own personal magical resources, which gives\n    the mage the ability to pick the spell right as it\'s being\n    cast, the sorcerer has to memorize specific spells, so can\n    only cast spells that are prepared for casting.  However,\n    once memorized, the sorcerer will not fail when he or she\n    calls on the magic.\n\n    Thief - This is the dangerous combination of ruthlessness\n    and duplicity.  A thief can do all sorts of dishonest things,\n    like steal, pick locks, spy, and remove traps.  In combat\n    the thief doesn\'t like to stand toe to toe against big\n    opponents with big swords.  However, if the thief can creep\n    up on an opponent, they can plant a dagger in their back,\n    and then the blood will flow.\n\n    Warrior - This is your basic big, strong person wearing a lot\n    of protective metal and holding a really big pointy\n    piece of metal.  A generalist in destruction and mayhem,\n    the warrior doesn\'t get any spells or magical abilities, but\n    makes up for that with a great selection of gear and the\n    ability to hit hard.  This is by far the most flexible of\n    the fighters, with better gear than the barbarian, more\n    options than the paladin, and more focussed than the ranger.\n\n');

For sheer damage, the monk is impressive, and\n    with some of the special skills, they can be great support\n    characters.  The monk\'s selection of armor and equipment tends\n    to be fairly poor, but the monk\'s training makes up for it,\n    easily.  A monk\'s natural \'armor class\' drops as he or she\n    goes up in levels, getting as good as "very well armored" and\n    the damage their fists do increases as their level increases.\n    Also they eventually become impervious to some effects, like hold\n    spells, charm spells, and poison.  They have the most natural\n    attacks of any fighter, but they can not receive \'haste\' spells\n    when they become immune to hold spells.  Monks have taken a vow\n    of poverty, so they can not make use of the banks found throughout\n    the realms.

INSERT INTO `helpTopics` VALUES (1, 'CLASS NECROMANCER', '\n    This class is a branch of magic that is avoided by most magic users.\n    The necromancer deals almost exclusively in death, and has great\n    power of the life forces of living beings and can create powerful\n    undead servants.  In order to keep in touch with this magic, the\n    necromancer must remain evil and dark.

While creating a similar effect to the mage\n    spell \'strength\', this ability is quite different, and can\n    actually be used in conjunction with the magic spell.  It\n    will last a long time, especially when used by powerful\n    psionists.  Psionic Masters have been known to maintain\n    this power for over four days before having to renew\n    the ability.\n\n\n');

The principle behind the ability\n    is similar to the \'probability travel\' skill.  The psionist\n    displaces the target, but only in location, thus keeping them\n    on the same plane.  As nature will not allow a person to be\n    nowhere for any length of time, the victim is ejected into the\n    material world, but in a random location.  The location is\n    completely random, it can be anywhere on the same plane of\n    existence, as long as no magical or natural barriers exist to\n    prevent the translocation.  While that guarantees not ending up\n    materializing inside of a boulder, it does not mean that you\n    won\'t end up in the air above a ravine, or landing in the\n    midst of a ravenous pack of wolves.  The fact that this\n    spell can be cast in combat means that you might save yourself\n    an agonizing death.  However, you also might jump from the\n    frying pan into the fire.  If it is used on another being,\n    that being can resist the displacement effect of the power,\n    and remain in the same location.\n\n\n');

Much like a fighter who is so much stronger\n    and bigger than another creature that he or she can manhandle\n    that creature.  By simply bringing the full weight of the\n    mind on an opponent, the psionist can literally break the\n    victim\'s brain.  Physical effects of this attack may be\n    bleeding from the ears, eyes, or nose.  The ability \'tower of\n    iron will\' can provide a great deal of protection to this\n    assault.\n\n\n');

This ability combines half\n    physical powers and half mental.  Physically the psionist\n    just barely rearranges some broad aspects of his body.  This\n    serves to give the psionist a somewhat generic humanoid\n    appearance.  Then, as any creature comes into contact with the\n    psionist, the psionist will snoop briefly into the top surface\n    of the creature\'s thoughts and pick out a non-threatening\n    disguise.  Then the psionist will make the creature see that\n    disguise rather than the psionist\'s true shape and appearance.\n    It will make any creature less likely to attack the psionist,\n    and it will also make any creatures who currently hate the\n    psionist forget about their hatred.  By reaching back to the\n    hated thoughts of his or her former foes, the psionist shifts\n    the blame from him or herself to another easily believable\n    target.  A powerful psionist can maintain this ability for\n    almost half of a day.\n\n\n');

By attuning his or her mind to\n    the perfectly formed image of the desired item, a feat requiring\n    great concentration and willpower, and casting out a wide\n    ranging psionic net, the psionist can actually see the place\n    where the object resides.  The net will only close down on\n    the specific item, and only one of the items if multiple exist.\n    If the object is carried by a psionist, they can prevent the\n    net from finding the item.\n\n\n');

It is easiest\n    to focus on living, thinking creatures, and so this ability can\n    be used to do one of two things.  By including a target creature\n    and a desired direction that is open for travel, the psionist\n    can push that creature from the current place towards that exit.\n    This can be very useful in moving creatures out of a battle area\n    before the battle starts.  It is impossible to push very large\n    creatures, not even the most powerful psionist has the strength\n    to move a giant.  The target can also resist the push, but it\n    will not realize what exactly happened, and so will not attack\n    the psionist.  The other use for this ability is during battle.\n    If the psionist is fighting someone, they can use this power to\n    lift the opponent in the air and quickly slam them to the ground.\n    This will definitely shake up the opponent, making them unable\n    to initiate any actions until they can start thinking clearly\n    again.\n\n\n');

Where \'mindblank\' tries to change the\n    thought pattern of the psionist\'s mind to hide the mind,\n    this skill makes no attempt at subterfuge.  It is a very\n    "noisy" ability, and it practically dares opponents to\n    try and mentally attack the psionist.  It provides a very\n    strong defense against other psionic abilities, but\n    doesn\'t tend to have much effect on any magical mind\n    attacks.  \'Psionic blast\', \'psychic crush\', and \'ultra\n    blast\' are all attacks that have a difficult time assaulting\n    the mind of a psionist protected by this skill.

Basically, by\n    creating the proper frequency of psionic energy, the psionist\n    can use it to scramble the brains of a large number of\n    opponents.  The effect can at most be tailored to only seven\n    or eight opponents at a time, achieving a frequency to affect\n    more than that would possibly kill the psionist.  Because the\n    frequency is somewhat generic, the victims of this ability\n    can resist the effects, and a \'tower of iron will\' gives\n    a further resistance to it.

I\'m new!"\n    The help is fairly extensive, type "help help help" to get\n    information on how to best use it.\n    There are help topics written for each character class for new\n    players, try "help newbie " then your character class.

Eventually, you can hit anything,\n    but if you find yourself missing all the time in a\n    fight, you might be experiencing this difficulty.\n\n    Learn \'dodge\', it\'s effects aren\'t very noticeable, but\n    they add up over time.\n\n    When you reach 10th level you must win a duel with another\n    monk to advance in level.\n\n    The monk guildmaster is outside the town of Karsinya in\n    the Monk Monastery to the northwest of the town.\n    From the Temple of Karsinya, the monk guildmaster is\n    s2e3n5w4n5w5n5e\n\n');

If you obey that,\n    you will likely never be in violation of any of the other rules of\n    the mud.  Punishments for failing to follow these rules vary, and\n    is at the discretion of the adjucating immortal.\n    \n    1.  \'Player Killing\' outside of the \'Arena\' is forbidden.  Even\n        indirectly harming another player is illegal, such as summoning\n        an unwilling player to a dangerous area.  Casting non-beneficial\n        spells on another character is illegal as well.\n        \n    2.  Stealing from another character is illegal, even if you know them.\n    \n    3.  Kill stealing is illegal, which is when somebody has already\n        started fighting a mob and you deal the final blow, robbing\n        the original player of the experience.  When in doubt, ask.\n\n    4.  Taking items off of the corpse of a recently deceased player\n        is illegal.  Only if the player has given you permission should\n        you get the items from a player\'s corpse.\n        \n    5.  Foul language will not be tolerated in any form, including\n        replacing letters with symbols.  If you want to make your\n        feelings known, get creative, cursing will be punished.\n        \n    6.  Whining, while not illegal, will certainly not win you any\n        friends.\n        \n    7.  \'Multi-playing\' is illegal, if you are caught \'multi-playing\'\n        you will be punished.\n        \n    8.  Sharing characters is illegal, your password is sacred.  Do\n        not share your character with friends, relatives, wives, \n        sons, etc.  And if your character gets hijacked by another\n        person, the mud is not responsible for any damages that\n        result from it.\n\n    9.  "Bots" are illegal.  A bot is a set of scripts that automate\n        your character to a greater extent than is acceptable by\n        the mud.  It is a judgement call by the immortals on what\n        constitutes a bot versus a set of triggers and scripts that\n        aid a mudder.  Basically, if you don\'t have to be at your\n        keyboard and your character is engaged in actions more\n        complex than standing in one spot and keeping yourself from\n        starving, you are probably close to bot-like activity.\n\n');

While\n    stunned, the opponent can not undertake any actions and will\n    suffer slightly more damage than if they were standing.  Until\n    the opponent stands up again, there are very few actions they\n    can effectively pursue.  If there are many people fighting close \n    to the target the fighter will have a hard time getting close \n    enough to bash the target.  If there is no target specified, \n    the fighter will bash the current opponent.  Any size fighter\n    can attempt to bash any size opponent.  Large size differentials\n    between the fighter and his or her target reduces the chance\n    of succeeding at the bash.  If a small fighter, like a dwarf,\n    attempted to bash a large target, like a giant, it will be much\n    harder than a half-giant attempting to bash the giant.  Likewise,\n    a half-giant will have a hard time bashing a goblin.  Being \n    slightly larger than your opponent grants the best chance to\n    successfully bash them, so a human attempting to bash a moon-elf\n    will have the easiest time.  The level difference between the\n    basher and the target will make a difference, so will being\n    a single-class, main-class, or a multi-class fighter, as well\n    as dexterity.  So the absolutely best opportunity is for a high \n    level, single class fighter with a high dexterity who is one size \n    larger than the target.  The time that the bash stuns the basher \n    and the victim is determined by how successful the bash was and \n    the strength of the basher.\n\n');

With\n    this skill the barbarian launches himself into a incredible\n    whirlwind of destruction while already fighting.  He or she gets\n    more attacks and hits much harder.  His or her aim suffers a\n    little, and he or she can\'t possibly think of anything as weak\n    as retreating, but in the meantime, the destructive ability is\n    unparalleled.\n\n');

A basic mental\n    assault to the target, it will scramble the brains, causing physical\n    damage.  At higher levels, the psionist can severely impair the combat\n    abilities of a target.  At the pinnacle of psionist power, the target\n    could even end up a vegetable, unable to even try to fight back.\n\n');

The higher level the paladin and the\n    more pure the target creature, the greater the blessing bestowed.\n    At a very minimum the target will receive the basic low level cleric\n    spells, such as \'bless\' and \'armor\'.  As the power of the blessing grows\n    so does it\'s effects, which are cumulative, the most powerful blessings\n    will grant multiple \'heal\' spells and a \'sanctuary\' spell.\n\n');

Not all spells are\n    able to be brewed, and the cost of the brewed spell is twice the\n    normal cost of the spell.  If the potion is created successfully,\n    then the potion can be quaffed by anybody to receive the effect\n    of the spell.\n\n');

Attacking\n    by surprise from behind, the thief can inflict a hideous amount\n    of damage in one blow.  However, once the attack has happened,\n    the thief then fights like any other fighter.  The thief must\n    be wielding a piercing weapon of some kind, a dagger is the\n    usual object of choice.  The thief can not backstab somebody\n    who is much bigger than they are, and will have a hard time\n    backstabbing somebody if there is a lot of fighting going on\n    around the target.\n\n');

You automatically \'mount\' the horse that\n    arrives, and it will obey your commands while you ride it.\n    If you don\'t wish to ride it any more you can \'dismount\' it\n    and it will remain where it is for you to come back.  The horse\n    will obey your orders while you ride it, and aid you in combat.\n\n');

Being hidden means that you can not\n    be targeted except by an opponent with both the \'sense life\' and\n    the \'true sight\' spells.  Area effect spells can still cause you\n    damage however.  Any activity will cancel out your hiding, and make\n    you visible to all.\n\n');

By specifying a number\n    of hitpoints after the command, the psionist can change hitpoints\n    into mana.  The number of mana points gained is twice as many\n    hitpoints.  So if you "canibalize 10" you would receive 20 mana\n    points.  You should be careful not to drain your life down so low\n    that you are in danger from physical attacks.  If you fail to\n    successfully canibalize the health, it is gone with no benefit.\n\n');

The corpse must\n    be of a size able to support this activity, a butterfly is\n    not going to make a good ration, but a dragon might provide\n    days worth of meals.\n\n');

It only provides access to magic, the spells themselves\n    determine all aspects of what happens.  You are either able to\n    cast spells or not, there is no "learning" of the cast skill.\n    See the individual help of the spell in question to learn what\n    it does and how it behaves.\n\n');

While\n    riding a mount, the paladin, who must be wielding a weapon that does\n    impale damage, rams into the target creature, inflicting terrible\n    damage.\n\n');

Obviously if\n    the exit you wish to go to is in midair, then there is no\n    way to climb to it.  Be careful, a slip here and you could fall\n    quite a ways and possibly be gravely injured.\n\n');

The first is only learned by\n    thieves, and that is to disarm deadly traps.  The other is\n    used by fighters to disarm an opponent.  Monks are more proficient\n    at this maneuver than other fighters.  If successful the weapon\n    of the opponent is sent flying from his or her hand and they are\n    forced to fight bare handed unless they can retrieve the weapon or\n    wield a new weapon.  Something to keep in mind is that many\n    creatures do devastating damage with their bare fists and the\n    weapon they wield makes little difference in the level of danger\n    they represent.\n\n');

Using the "-skill" argument will tell\n    you how well you have learned this skill and using the command\n    without any argument while fighting will cause you to stop\n    fighting if successful.  If you are the tank for a fight and\n    attempt this, chances are the opponent will start hitting you\n    again as soon as he or she can.\n\n');

This skill, which can only be used once a day, will\n    keep you safe from somebody you have been fighting with earlier.\n    They will not recognize you and will not attack you, unless they\n    would normally attack you by being \'aggressive\'.\n\n');

While wielding a primary weapon, some weapons are of a\n    size that allows them to be held in the other hand, providing an\n    extra attack.  There is no command associated with this skill, if\n    a weapon is held, it is called in combat.  Failing the skill will\n    result in fumbling and dropping the held weapon, perhaps even\n    fumbling your primary weapon as well.\n\n');

It doesn\'t\n    do anything to help the psionist speak any language, but at least\n    he or she can understand anybody while the skill lasts, which may\n    be as long as a day at the highest level of ability.\n\n');

If successful, the monk will immediately pretend to be\n    struck down fatally in combat.  The opponents being thus fooled\n    will stop fighting, leaving the monk free to recover.  If the monk\n    is very good at this skill, he or she might not even be noticed\n    anymore, being hidden in plain sight as a corpse.\n\n');

It requires no particular concentration\n    on the part of the thief, the traps are visible to him or\n    her just like any other object of a room.  The majority of\n    traps are triggered by disturbing them by touching them or\n    by attempting to move past them.\n\n');

This skill lasts much\n    longer than the \'fireshield\' spell, and as long as it lasts, if\n    anybody hits the psionist, the shroud will scorch them with fire.\n\n');

It deals\n    between 6 and 36 points of damage to as many as 7 opponents.\n    This damage comes from focussing the chi to allow a brief moment\n    where the monk\'s punching fist is actually in several places at\n    once.\n\n');

By focussing the chi,\n    the monk can make combat seem to move more slowly, giving\n    him more attacks and a better chance of hitting his opponents.\n    It only lasts for one round of combat, and after that you\n    have to recover for a bit before trying again.\n\n');

Using this will grant the psionist the same effects\n    as the spells \'true sight\', \'sense life\' and \'detect invisibility\'.\n    The amount of time all the effects last is different for each effect,\n    but the more powerful the psionist, the longer the effect lasts.\n\n');

Acting much like the \'rescue\' skill, it\n    allows the paladin to step in between his or her companion and\n    the dangerous opponents they were fighting.  It is considered\n    significantly superior to the \'rescue\' skill in the fact that\n    no target has to be specified.  This is because the \'heroic\n    rescue\' skill will automatically rescue all members of your group\n    from combat.  If you have 3 group members fighting 2 different\n    opponents, doing a \'heroic rescue\' will mean that the 2 group\n    members who were being attacked by the opponents will be rescued\n    from the combat and you will now be getting attacked by both of the\n    opponents they were fighting.  Essentially, the paladin will be\n    throwing himself in between his or her companions and any opponent\n    of the group.\n\n');

The ranger can only use this ability\n    outside, but the monk and thief can use it anywhere.  If you\n    successfully hide, you will be almost completely undetectable.\n    Without the \'sense life\' spell or ability, any other creature\n    will have no idea that you are even present in the room.  Without\n    \'sense life\' and \'true sight\' you can not even be targeted by\n    another creature.

It allows the barbarian or ranger to\n    track down a particular creature.  While not all creatures can\n    be tracked, the more skilled you are at hunting, the farther\n    away the target can be and still be tracked.

If a creature is\n    extraordinarily stupid, it is impossible to create a mental\n    connection to it.

If successful the monk will knock the target down\n    to the ground, temporarily stunning them.  The monk also needs\n    time to recover from the attack.  If all goes well the monk\n    will be ready to legsweep the opponent again when the opponent\n    finally starts to stand up.

While meditating, which is a position\n    similar to resting, the psionist will recover mana faster than\n    if he or she were just resting.  Probably not as fast as sleeping\n    but the psionist is still aware of all that happens around him\n    or her while meditating.\n\n');

Instead of using mana to power any\n    spell, the sorcerer commits a particular spell to memory, then\n    instead of using \'cast\' to launch a spell, the sorcerer uses\n    \'recall\' to launch the spell.  However, once the sorcerer has\n    successfully memorized a spell, he or she can recall it perfectly,\n    there is no chance of the spell failing.  Low power spells, memorized\n    by a very intelligent high level sorcerer takes practically no time\n    at all.  However, a very powerful spell that is just at the edge of\n    your ability to cast will take much longer.\n\n');

Failure means that the equipment is actually\n    worse off than it was before the attempted mending, but success\n    brings the gear back to full strength, even weapons.\n\n');

Nobody but the user and the target know\n    what is said, or even that anything was said.  This is similar\n    to a global \'tell\' command.\n\n');

When successfully used, this power\n    opens a brief portal to the target, and every companion of\n    the psionist steps through it, appearing instantly at the\n    target\'s location.\n\n');

It can only push away\n    physical threats, so it protects against the psionist in combat.  The\n    barrier grows stronger as the psionist gets stronger, eventually\n    protecting better than any armor ever crafted.\n\n');

By focussing on the target,\n    the psionist can create a portal wherever the target is, and move the\n    portal around the creature.  This is the opposite of how the psionist\n    uses the \'doorway\' skill.  Instead of making a portal from him or\n    herself to the target, the psionist makes a portal at the target and\n    brings the target to him or her.  The target is not prepared for this\n    and will likely be disoriented by the trip.  You can not summon\n    creatures who are more powerful than you, and this portal can only\n    work on the same plane of existence.  Sometimes the target will be\n    protected from this type of ability through magic.  This skill is\n    different from the \'summon\' spell that mages, sorcerers, and clerics\n    receive.  Sometimes the spell will be blocked, while this ability\n    can reach the target.\n\n');

In that brief moment, the\n    psionist convinces the creature that he or she is not there.\n    When a creature looks to where the psionist is, their brain\n    refuses to acknowledge what is in front of them.  However, due\n    to the magical way that the \'detect invisibility\' spell works,\n    it will show the truth of even an invisible psionist.  Any\n    attack will dispel the invisibility automatically, and it can\n    be cancelled manually by using the \'vis\' command.  The longest\n    this power can be maintained is a day.\n\n');

By\n    concentrating chi into the hand, and a near perfect knowledge\n    of physical and spiritual anatomy, the monk can set up\n    deadly vibrations in the body and soul of an opponent.  If\n    successful, the opponent will likely drop dead, due to an\n    interruption in the flow of blood and chi.  If an opponent\n    is more powerful than you, or has a great deal more hitpoints,\n    then this skill will be ineffectual against them.  This\n    devastating ability is so draining that it can only be\n    performed once a week.\n\n');

Magic casters, such as mages, clerics,\n    and so on have this skill automatically.  Other classes must\n    learn it, same as any other skill.  When you \'recite\' a scroll\n    it checks against this skill, failing this skill results in a\n    failed scroll.\n\n');

If the sorcerer\n    has a spell memorized, this command will release it and\n    the effects are determined by which spell it is.  This\n    command can never fail, if the spell has been memorized,\n    recalling it is flawless.\n\n');

Provided\n    that you are on the same plane as your home town (the inn where\n    you last rented), this command will return you to that place.\n    However, it is not a sure thing, your chances of successfully\n    recalling decrease as your level increases.  Your percentage\n    of successfully doing it ranges from 100% as a brand new\n    character to 2% as a powerful hero.  If you do use the command\n    successfully, you will be instantly returned, but your movement\n    will have been drained to 0.\n\n');

The scroll\n    will burst into flames, so it is not reusable, and the target\n    of the scroll will be the target of whatever spells are released.\n\n');

If successful, the target is removed\n    from combat with that opponent, but other opponents can still\n    continue to attack the target.  The target will be temporarily\n    stunned by the rescue and won\'t be able to initiate new actions\n    until he or she recovers.\n\n');

You can use the \'retreat\' command, but\n    it merely calls the \'flee\' command.  If you succeed in your\n    retreat skill, you will not flee blindly and not lose\n    experience for running away.  It merely turns what was\n    a panicky maneuver into one that has some order to it.\n\n');

If you have learned the\n    riding skill well, you will fall off your mount far less\n    often than if you have not learned anything about it, which\n    can be a big difference if you plan on fighting from the\n    back of your mount.\n\n');

By\n    controlling the fall and landing, a normally fatal fall\n    will be merely incredibly painful.\n\n');

The spell is decided by the cleric,\n    and it costs twice as much mana to put it on a scroll as\n    it does to cast it normally.  The scroll has a limited\n    shelf life, it\'s not stable and will dissolve in a matter\n    of hours.  The scroll can be recited just like any other\n    scroll.  Not all spells are able to be scribed onto a\n    scroll, check the individual spell help to see if that\n    spell can be scribed.\n\n');

It will slow down your travelling, since you must take\n    more care with your steps, but if successful,  you will be able\n    to sneak past almost any creature.  However, in order to sneak about,\n    you can not be wearing any item that makes noise, such as a powerful\n    magic item that hums.  Rangers can not sneak indoors, only outdoors,\n    so this skill has limited use for them in urban settings.\n\n');

Only the paladin and the ranger can learn this skill from\n    their guildmasters.  But there is another teacher of this skill that\n    any fighter can learn from.  You can not spot any creatures that you\n    normally wouldn\'t be able to see anyway, such as hidden creatures,\n    or invisible creatures.  Spotting in a direction will narrow your\n    focus, which can be useful in crowded areas.\n\n');

The effect of this is to stun the\n    opponent for a short time while doing some damage to the opponent\n    and to regain your feet, so that you are standing and ready to\n    continue the fight.\n\n');

If this\n    skill is successful, you will see into the next room exactly\n    as though you were there.  Very useful for looking before\n    leaping.\n\n');

Also if the target\n    has some items in his or her inventory, then they can be\n    stolen as well.  Of course the possibility exists that you\n    might fail and get caught, but that is the risk that all\n    thieves will take.\n\n');

This is accomplished using the \'kill\' or \'hit\' command\n    during combat.  By typing the name of a different opponent than\n    the one you are currently hitting, you will attempt to switch\n    over and begin beating on the new opponent.

By\n    shouting out the battle cry of his or her god, the paladin can\n    actually cause an enemy to feel as though they were physically\n    struck.  The more powerful the paladin is in relation to the\n    target determines how effective the warcry is.

Once there, the swarm will kill\n    indiscriminately, and even has a chance to wander around into\n    other areas once it has devoured all in that room.

The effect lasts\n    a long time, in the range of a full week.  However, far more\n    insidious is casting this spell on an object.  A cursed object\n    becomes unable to be wielded by good aligned creatures, and\n    no creature can get rid of it without casting \'remove curse\'\n    on the item.

However, this spell has some limitations.  If the target\n    is not on the normal plane, the shadow realm has no access to them.\n    Obviously this means that if you are on a different plane than your\n    home plane, you also have no access to the shadow realm.

Immediately the target\'s internal organs\n    spasm, causing damage, but more insidiously, for almost\n    a handful of hours, the decay continues, eating away at\n    the body of the target.  Forget about healing or regaining\n    mana while under the effect of this spell, and also most\n    races take massive damage every hour from this spell, as\n    the spell literally liquifies the insides of the target.\n    Halflings are somewhat resistant to this spell, taking\n    less damage than other races.\n\n\n');

This spell removes magical effects from the target.  If\n    the target is affected by the \'sanctuary\' spell, casting \'dispel\n    magic\' can remove it from them.  Think of this spell as a contest\n    between the caster and the magic user who cast the spells the\n    \'dispel magic\' wants to dispel.  \'Dispel magic\' will attempt to\n    remove each magical effect on the target.  If the caster is the\n    equal or more powerful than the magic, then the magic is dispelled.\n    If the caster is less powerful than the magic, then the creature that\n    has the magical effect can resist the attempt to remove it.  So a less\n    powerful caster could potentially dispel only some of the magical\n    effects of a target.  Only very powerful magic users can dispel the\n    magical effects of items, but once that has been done, it allows\n    the spell \'enchant weapon\' or \'enchant armor\' to be cast.\n\n\n');

The cloud is not\n    completely opaque and it has the tendency to clearly outline\n    shapes, which means that you can see the edges of invisible\n    creatures, and will even make hidden creatures visible.  If\n    the hidden creature resists the spell, they are able to\n    re-hide themselves after being revealed.

For instance, if a creature has the\n    spell \'sanctuary\' cast on them, \'darkness\' would hide the white glow\n    that is associated with the \'sanctuary\' spell.

If the druid\n    successfully touches the victim, the metal objects of that\n    creature begin to heat up, eventually becoming hot enough\n    to scorch flesh badly.

Once that has happened, he can\n    absorb it for his own use, replenishing his own magical\n    reservoir.  The amount stripped is random, but usually is\n    enough to at least pay the caster back for the cost of the\n    \'soul steal\' spell.  Sometimes it is enough to power expensive\n    spells.

Since\n    the spell \'plant gate\' requires a druid to know the given\n    name of a tree, this spell can be used to help the druid\n    to discover the names of any tree he or she runs across.\n    Only trees can be talked to this way, and they usually\n    don\'t have too much to say.\n\n\n');

It is light\n    enough to not hinder the caster at all, but it also does not\n    give much protection.

While not truly turning the skin to stone, it takes\n    on some of the color and properties of stone, and makes it\n    much harder for enemies to successfully hit the caster.\n    As a side benefit, this also gives the caster some\n    resistance against stabbing and piercing attacks.  It\n    should reduce the damage by these types of attacks by\n    one half.  The duration of the effect is governed strictly\n    by the power of the caster.\n\n\n');

The period of time is determined by\n    the power of the caster.  The actual gain of strength is\n    determined somewhat by what kind of role the target is\n    involved in.

The bones usually match the armor,\n    so that a rib cage will form over the breastplate, and\n    a femur over the leggings, etc.  The protection provided\n    by this spell is a nice benefit, at least twice as much\n    as provided by \'spectral shield\'.

By\n    casting this with a fellow adventurer as the target, the\n    target is immediately brought to your location.  There is\n    no failure, except to fail the spell normally, through losing\n    concentration.  However, it can also be used to bring an\n    unwilling target, like a monster.  If that is the case, then\n    the target receives the chance to resist the spell.  There\n    are many conditions regarding the summoning of creatures.\n    They must be on the same plane of existence as you.  If either\n    you or the target are in a peaceful room, like the Reception,\n    then summoning is impossible.  If you are underwater, or\n    floating in mid-air, summoning isn\'t possible, you must have\n    contact with the ground to send out the questing magic.  If\n    the target is more than mortal, then summoning is impossible.\n    If you are in a constricted space, then it is impossible to\n    summon another person to it.  If the target is fighting, then\n    they can not be summoned from the combat.  If the room they\n    are in is magically protected, or the room you are in is\n    magically protected, you can not summon the target.\n    Rarely, the gods decide to make the planes shift and swirls,\n    which also means that any extra-dimensional travel is\n    impossible.  Despite all these restrictions, this is still\n    a very useful spell, which can save a lot of time.\n\n\n');

A blazing shaft of sunlight\n    streams from above, bathing all in the room.  Any person\n    not allied with the caster has a chance to be temporarily\n    blinded by the spell.  If a creature is wearing equipment\n    that doesn\'t tolerate sunlight, like drow equipment, then\n    the equipment will likely be destroyed by the sunray.\n    Finally, if the creature is undead or something like a\n    myconoid, then it will take anywhere from 6 through 48\n    points of damage.

Not\n    recommended unless no other options present themselves.  By\n    casting this spell the magic user sends a jolt of magical\n    energy into the immediate world around him or her.  The end\n    result of that jolt is to displace the caster from his or her\n    location and allow the magic to carry him or her away to\n    some other location.  The location is completely random, it\n    can be anywhere on the same plane of existence, as long as\n    no magical or natural barriers exist to prevent the\n    translocation.  While that guarantees not ending up\n    materializing inside of a boulder, it does not mean that you\n    won\'t end up in the air above a ravine, or landing in the\n    midst of a ravenous pack of wolves.  The fact that this\n    spell can be cast in combat means that you might save yourself\n    an agonizing death.  However, you also might jump from the\n    frying pan into the fire.

The power of the druid\n    directly corresponds to the power of the tree form.  And\n    the tree is of course ambulatory, usually with a lot of\n    attacks and a high resistance to damage.

Casting\n    \'tree travel\' actually results in becoming slightly closer to\n    nature than normal.  The effect of this is to give the caster\n    a small edge in detecting dangers in combat, making them a\n    little harder to hit.  The spell lasts for a full day, and\n    costs little in terms of magical power, so most wise druids\n    will maintain it constantly.\n\n\n');

A Dungeon Master could refer to someone\n    who is helping to run a quest.  In mudding terms this\n    term refers to the spell \'dispel magic\'.

The formula used to determine this\n    is based on the experience you need for the next level.\n    You can not earn more than 10% of the experience needed for\n    the next level in one battle.  So if you need 30,000 experience\n    to advance from level 5 to level 6, you can not earn more than\n    3,000 experience per fight.  This is based on the overall\n    experience needed, not your current amount needed.  There is\n    a cap to this amount, which is modified by how many people\n    are in your group.  The limit for killing a mob solo is 150,000\n    experience, regardless of how much you need to level.  If you\n    are in a group with one other person, the limit is raised to\n    250,000 experience.  An extra 100,000 experience is added for\n    each additional group member.

The\n    higher the level of the immortal, the more power and authority\n    they wield.  Earning immortality is a combination of demonstrating\n    knowledge and experience of the mud and showing an appreciation of\n    the culture and the goals of the mud.

The phrase "guild hall"\n    usually refers to a place where many guilds can be found close to\n    one another.

But it can also be applied to any number of other\n    teachers who do not teach to only one class, but rather have skills\n    that can be taught to many different kinds of characters.

Every mud hour, creatures regain\n    some of their lost hitpoints, mana, and move.  So if someone asks\n    you "How is your hit regen?" they are asking how many hitpoints\n    do you regenerate naturally per \'tick\'.  The second is\n    an effect that some equipment has that can alter how many hit\n    points are regenerated per \'tick\'.

Hitroll in a general manner can\n    refer to the overall hitroll bonus sum of a character, which\n    can be viewed in general terms using the \'attribute\' command.\n\n    Quite bad\n    Pretty lousy\n    Not Much of one\n    Not bad\n    Pretty good\n    Damn good\n    Very good\n    Extremely good\n    Magnificent\n\n');

Weapons are the\n    most common type of equipment with this particular effect, and\n    it represents an equal amount of the modifier being applied to\n    both \'hitroll\' and \'damroll\'.

A creature with a few hitpoints can die\n    far more easily.  There are a list of classifications of how\n    healthy a creature appears to be, but it is only relative to\n    the total number of hitpoints the creature has.

Immunity to a damage form is\n    very unusual, but powerful mobs could theoretically be immune or\n    they might be able to \'resist\' many different types of damage or\n    effects.  A mob might even be especially \'susceptible\' to damage\n    of a particular type, such as fire to a frost giant.  If a mob\n    is immune to a particular type of damage or effect it can not be\n    harmed or affected at all by that type.  So if a mob is immune\n    to charm effects, the spell \'charm monster\' will have no effect\n    at all on the mob.

Mana as a mudding\n    term usually refers to the amount of magical energy you have.\n    If you say, "I have 250 mana." you are telling people that is\n    how much magical energy you can store total.

Move regen is primarily a factor of\n    your age, your race, and your equipment.  You\n    regen \'move\' fastest towards early middle age, and some\n    races have a bonus.  Many items can help you to regain more\n    \'move\' per \'tick\', so if you find an object that says\n    "MOVE-REGEN By 5", you will regenerate 5 more \'move\' per\n    \'tick\' if you wear it.\n\n');

The more move you have, the farther you can\n    walk before resting and the more you can fight before\n    getting too tired to swing your weapon.  So if you say\n    "I have 120 move." you are expressing that your maximum\n    amount of vitality is 120.

Move is the mud\'s way of keeping track\n    of how tired you are.  Every step you take drains some\n    of your move, and every swing you take in combat drains\n    some more.  The more move you have, the farther you can\n    walk before resting and the more you can fight before\n    getting too tired to swing your weapon.  So if you say\n    "I have 120 move." you are expressing that your maximum\n    amount of vitality is 120.  An item you find might say\n    that is affects "MOVE By 10" in which case wearing that\n    item will increase your maximum amount of move by 10.\n\n');

A person who is just\n    learning how to mud is considered a newbie while they gain the\n    knowledge needed to mud proficiently.  It is not a derogative\n    term, but it is descriptive.  If more experienced players are\n    aware that you are a newbie, they will usually go out of their\n    way to help you, all you have to do is admit to being a newbie.\n    Everybody was a newbie at some point in time, there is no\n    shame attached to it, and if somebody does attempt to bring\n    some negative connotation to it, they are being jerks and should\n    be ignored and reported to the immortals.  There is a good deal\n    of help directed towards new players, so feel free to avail\n    yourself of that, even experienced mudders can usually find a tip\n    or two in the newbie documentation, a place to start is\n    "help newbie list".\n\n');

INSERT INTO `helpTopics` VALUES (1, 'TERM SUSCEPTIBLE', '\n    This term refers to the idea that a creature can be very\n    vulnerable to certain damage types or effects.  This could be\n    naturally occurring, such as a frost giant being susceptible to fire,\n    or it could be granted by an item.  Susceptibility to a damage form is\n    somewhat unusual, but it could be an Achilles heel useable against\n    powerful mobs who might be immune or resistant to many different types\n    of damage or effects.  If a mob is susceptible to a particular type of\n    damage or effect it will take double damage from that type and be much\n    more likely to be affected by that type.  So if a mob is susceptible\n    to charm effects, the spell \'charm monster\' will have a much greater\n    chance of affecting the mob.

Without an argument the \'alias\' command will print out your\n    current aliases.  The aliases are commands that use the numbers 0 through\n    9 as shortcuts.  Typing "1" will result in the command stored in the\n    "1" alias to be sent to the mud.  So if you find yourself typing: kill\n    orc a lot, you can alias it to 1, so that anytime you see an orc you just\n    have to type "1", instead of "kill orc".  Any valid mud command can be\n    aliased in this manner by including a single digit and then a command\n    after the \'alias\' command.  See the usage of these aliases by looking at\n    "help UTIL 0" or "help UTIL 9".  Be careful about assigning an alias to\n    "1" because if you should happen to die and have pre-typed "1", the menu\n    you see after you die uses "1" as the option of entering the game at\n    the inn you last rented at.

It was created with the idea that mortals and\r\nimmortals would treat each other with respect so that it would be a fun place\r\nfor everyone.  Since there is no way to screen every person who immorts, it\r\nis necessary for us to have a code of conduct for immortals.\r\n\r\nIt goes as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Please do not swear over public channels.  It gives immortals a bad name,\r\n   and it\'s also rude.\r\n\r\n2. Please do not misuse your powers in a way that would hurt any other\r\n   character.\r\n\r\n3. Please do not tolerate the swearing of any players, whether mortal or\r\n   immortal.  If a player is caught swearing over public channels, give them\r\n   warning that they are breaking the rules, and, if swearing persists,\r\n   despite warnings, disconnect the player.\r\n\r\n4. Please do not insult other players.  We want this mud to be one where\r\n   everyone feels welcome.  If two players have a disagreement, they can settle\r\n   it between themselves.  No public channels are to be used to exchange\r\n   insults.\r\n\r\n5. Please do not share untrue information with newbies.  For example, when they\r\n   ask for directions somewhere, do not give them directions to a death trap.\r\n\r\n6. Respect all immortals, especially ones higher then you.\r\n\r\n7. Respect all mortals, even newbies.  They may not be as good a player as you,\r\n   but they still deserve respect.\r\n\r\n8. Do not threaten anyone with character deletion for reasons other then\r\n   repetitive breaking of (unnamed yet) rules.\r\n\r\n9. Please discuss all major decisions with one or more of the implementors:\r\n   Pentak, Xenon, or Tsaron.\r\n\r\n10. If you have any problems with any immortal, explain the situation to an\r\n    implementor and they will decide what should be done.  Do not take the\r\n    punishment of anyone into your own hands.\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with this code of conduct will result in restricted use of\r\nyour immortal character, and ultimately deletion of your character if bad\r\nconduct continues.  We take these rules seriously, and as immortals, our job is\r\nto be good examples to mortals so that all will, if not get along, try to\r\ntolerate each other.\r\n\r\nSee Also: RULES INFO\r\n');
INSERT INTO `helpTopics` VALUES (2, 'INFO\r', '\r\nAs immortals, we basically know everything that goes on in the MUD.  Some of\r\nthis information may be imparted to players, but other information is not\r\nappropriate to share with anyone.  In light of the fact that as immortals,\r\nwe may or may not know what we\'re allowed to tell players, this list of\r\nrules has been made for your convenience.  Please do not share any of the\r\nfollowing information with any player:\r\n\r\n1. Locations of zones not finished yet.  If a player ends up in a zone that\r\n   isn\'t finished yet, a lot of problems could arise.  So just to be on the\r\n   safe side, don\'t transfer players to an unfinished zone or tell them how\r\n   to get there.\r\n\r\n2. Locations of the best equipment in the game.  The object of the game is\r\n   to allow players to explore the mud themselves, and find their own EQ\r\n   and experience points.  If an immortal helps a player by locating EQ and\r\n   mobs, it defeats the purpose of the game, and also shows favoritism.\r\n\r\n3. Anything deemed by any other immortal as "secret" or "private" or\r\n   anything else along that line.  The times of any arenas or quests that\r\n   might be held, as well as what will be expected of the player on a quest\r\n   are all things that would give a player an unfair advantage over those\r\n   who wouldn\'t know this information.\r\n\r\nAlso, please do not do any of the following for a mortal, unless\r\nspecifically allowed to do so by a higher immortal:\r\n\r\n1. Do not restring or re-edit a piece of equipment to the player\'s advantage\r\n   unless the player has won the restring somehow.  Also, do not change the\r\n   stats of equipment for a player\'s benefit.  Again, this would be showing\r\n   favoritism.  It would also seem very strange for a mortal to be wearing a\r\n   piece of equipment that would give him/her 1000 extra hit points.\r\n\r\n2. Do not give maps of certain zones or areas to mortals.  They are supposed\r\n   to explore and find out things by themselves.  At some times, locations\r\n   of DT\'s MAY be imparted, however, it\'s best not to give any information\r\n   regarding this topic.\r\n\r\n3. Do not become the group leader of any group, allowing yourself to find,\r\n   go to, or help kill mobs and get experience points or equipment for\r\n   anything else along that line.  The times of any arenas or quests that\r\n   might be held, as well as what will be expected of the player on a quest\r\n   are all things that would give a player an unfair advantage over those\r\n   who wouldn\'t know this information.\r\n\r\nAlso, please do not do any of the following for a mortal, unless\r\nspecifically allowed to do so by a higher immortal:\r\n\r\n1. Do not restring or re-edit a piece of equipment to the player\'s advantage\r\n   unless the player has won the restring somehow.  Also, do not change the\r\n   stats of equipment for a player\'s benefit.  Again, this would be showing\r\n   favoritism.  It would also seem very strange for a mortal to be wearing a\r\n   piece of equipment that would give him/her 1000 extra hit points.\r\n\r\n2. Do not give maps of certain zones or areas to mortals.  They are supposed\r\n   to explore and find out things by themselves.  At some times, locations\r\n   of DT\'s MAY be imparted, however, it\'s best not to give any information\r\n   regarding this topic.\r\n\r\n3. Do not become the group leader of any group, allowing yourself to find,\r\n   go to, or help kill mobs and get experience points or equipment for \r\n   players.  Do not join any mortal groups unless otherwise instructed by\r\n   a higher immortal.\r\n\r\nThese rules are designed to keep immortality the enigma and honor that it\r\nis.  Once a player has immorted, they have deserved the right to some of\r\nthese things, as well as the information that perhaps they hadn\'t known\r\nbefore.  Just keep these things in mind when mortals are asking you\r\nquestions.  If you don\'t know whether or not to impart certain information,\r\nuse your good judgement.  That is, for those of you who HAVE good judgement.\r\nFor the rest of you, ask someone, or tell the mortal that you\'re simply not\r\nallowed to give out that kind of information.\r\n');
