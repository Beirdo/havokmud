AGING AGE  
Age is your starting age plus the number of game years that have passed  since 
your character was created, regardless of how much of that time you spent 
rented, and how much playing.  To see the current game year use  'time'.  
The haste spell adds to your age (permanently) as does some  equipment (temporarily.)    
Age has several game effects.  Start to middle age - move (vitality) regeneration, hit 
point regeneration rate                        increases.   Middle age to old age - your 
maximum hit points, move regen, and HP regen decrease.  Ancient and older - Everything 
starts decreasing..

ALIAS      
alias -- no arguments - shows a list of your existing aliases.       
alias <num> command -- assigns the command to the number num, which has to be between 0 and 9.
<num> will execute this command.      

example:  > alias 1 kill    > 1 lamia    You hit the lamia. Get the idea?  Only one command per 
alias, 

# 
ALIGNMENT

  The alignment a player follows is dependant of what kind of creatures
  he tends to kill. Killing good aligned mobiles will make you evil, killing
  evil aligned creatures will make you good, and killing a nice mix of those
  will keep you neutral. Paladins are required to stay good aligned, while
  druids cannot become good or evil. Rangers cannot become evil. Other classes
  don't have alignment issues, other than the fact some equipment might pop off.

ARENA

  Occasionally, the Gods will like to see a test of strength from mortals.
  By opening an Arena, players can test their prowess in battle against
  fellow players, without the risk of losing experience, equipment or money
  if they die. To see if the Arena is currently open, just type 'arena'.

# 
"ARMOR CLASS"  
Armor Class is based on the AD&D idea that the lower ones AC is, the less often they 
get hit.  Armor classes range from "barely armored" to "armored like a dragon".  In 
numeric terms, this is a range from 100 to -100.  If you are acquainted with AD&D, 
a 100 corresponds to a 10 AC, and a -100 corresponds to a -10 AC.    Dexterity also 
affects how often you get hit, the higher your dexterity  (up to 18) the lower your 
natural AC (your AC without any armor or spells on).  For every point of dexterity 
above 15 (16+) your natural (100) AC  is reduced by 10.  This does not apply to monks.  
The highest AC that a person can have is -100.  The AC-apply works this way: The raw 
AC-apply is multiplied by a multiplier, and subtracted from total  armor class.          

Area        Body  Head  Legs  Feet  Hands  Arms  Shield Other   
Multiplier   *3    *2    *2    *1     *1    *1      *1   *0  

Example, wearing a AC-apply 5 breastplate(body) gives you -15 to AC.

# 
ASSIST     
If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same person the <player> is.     
ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player> continues fighting. It is better than 
KILL in many cases because you do not have to choose between 1.golem and 2.golem 
(or 1.lamia that just entered the room). Even though monsters of the same type assist 
each other in combat, ASSIST is better because you will eliminate one aggressor much 
faster.

paranoid about fire wielding mages and other natural sources of flame.  
Avariel can be Mage, Clerics, and Warriors, and any combination thereof.  
They may advance to Level 45 Mage, Level 40 Cleric and Level 50 Warrior.

# 
BREATH      
Usage : breath <Target Mob>         
           : breath      

The breath command allows you to use a breath weapon on another monster.  The only way to get a breath weapon is to either be a monster with such an ability (dragons usually have one) or quaff a potion of fire/ice/acid/gas/lightning breath.     If you are already fighting, breath without any arguments will breath on the monster you are fighting.  If you are NOT fighting you must supply the name of a target to breath on.     Breath weapons are terrifying and most opponents will flee before you get a chance to breath on them.  However, you may blast bystanders with the same breath.     This means breath weapons are not terribly accurate.  You will always hit the monster you target and will usually hit his group, followers and his leader.  You will also probably blast anyone currently hitting on you.  You also have a small chance (less than half) of hitting each bystander (someone not covered above).  They will not appreciate this and will probably decide to beat the snot out of you.     When quaffed breath potions modify you so that you can breath ONE time.  If you do not breath in 2-3 rounds the potion will explode inside you causing half of its normal damage.  These potions also reduce your CON for the duration of the spell.  You therefore cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you have constitution.  You also cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you have levels.     The damage of a breath weapon is a function of its level, your level, and your hitpoints.  If your level is equal to the breath weapon's level it will do your hitpoints worth of damage to the target.  If your level is double the level of the breath weapon it will only do half your hitpoints of damage.  Monsters natural breath weapons exceed the CON restriction and even a 50th level monster can do full damage.  Since most huge monsters have huge hitpoints, this can be a LOT of damage.  do not ever fight a titanium dragon.

GROUP GROUPING 
Usage : GROUP [player]   
Some new changes to encourage grouping.    1) leader of a group gets 5% exp bonus per kill per pc in group 2) followers get 3% bonus (per pc)   If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been participating in the fight.  Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.   To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader should remember to include himself in the group.   Example:   Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.   Quifael : "follow dragon" Redferne: "follow dragon" (Dragon should be following no one but himself) Dragon  : "group dragon" Dragon  : "group redferne" Dragon  : "group quifael"   Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time) he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

IMMORTALITY  
Some characters have left this mortal coil and become Immortals (sometimes  referred to as god or wizards.)  You may REQUEST immortality after you  earn  200,000,000 experience per class.  Very rarely, someone will be given an  immortal for some significant service to the mud.  We ask that when you request immortality, you do so with ALL your  equipment still intact, to keep equipment circulating, and prove your  commitment.  Please do not get rid of anything that you normally used over  the adept portion of your career, and give away NOTHING at all for the last  10 or so million experience.  If you played a well equipped adept, we expect  you to sacrifice a well equipped adept in order to become an immortal.   Trying to weasel around this and find loopholes will show you are not suited  to immortality, where you must obey strict rules, enforce the intent of  rules, and consider the good of the mud before your own personal good.  Newbie Immortals (level 51) are give limited power and must follow strict   rule preventing them from helping (or harming) mortals.  They must not  interfere with the normal running of the game.  The are not allowed to use  their immortal character to gain any information about the mud.  As immortals  perform services to the MUD, such as writing zones, they may be advanced in  level. The highest immortals, the true gods of the mud, are bound only by  their own code of honor.  The rules they set for lower gods express how they  expect the mud to be run.  Do not ask them to do thing lower gods are not  allowed to do, as they may get irritated.    **** THINK carefully before you ask to become an IMMORTAL! *****  Many people find it VERY boring.  You can't group with friends, can't kill  stuff, can't cast spells on mortals, and can't explore anything.  Even what  you say to others becomes restricted, as you may have privileged information,  and are considered to be representing the MUD when you speak to mortals.   Unless you wish to write zones or do other work on the mud, immortality is  rather pointless.

INTRO INTRODUCTION    
things you should know:      
hit points are ad&d like, not diku like    there are 150+ spells, almost 30 skills, more on the way.    many monsters have special routines.    most monsters that might have poison do.    poison is very dangerous.    some poisonous monsters have instantly fatal poison.  take care!    equipment can be damaged, by spells and combat.    dragons breath, doing lots of damage to people and equipment.    non pc followers only get 1/2 the exp they would get if they weren't    charmed.  the other 1/2 is lost.    Some monsters are too big to bash.. in general, dragons, most 'huge'    things, purple worm, etc, are all non-bashable.    sneak allows you to avoid aggressive monsters.    monsters develop hatreds very quickly, and will try to hunt you down      and kill you for hurting them.    kangaroos hate all kinds of enfan.    most mobs that should see in the dark do.    some monsters are immune to the things you would expect them to be    immune to.       some monsters are also resistant to certain attacks and/or susceptible    to others (resist = 1/2 damage, susc = 2* dam)    monsters HELP each other out.  They don't sit by and watch.          player characters are very powerful:  many spells, attacks, etc.    monsters are weaker individually, most of the time.  However, the       monsters here are not as stupid as they are on other muds, and they    tend to be tougher, because of that, and because they help each    other.      rule of thumb:  Grouping is a good idea.        it is easier to play mages and thieves if you are patient.  You don't    have to be as patient, if you are more willing to group.      My goals for the classes:      Fighters: powerful at lower levels, much less useful at higher levels.      Clerics:  reasonably powerful and useful all along.      Mages:    weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.      Thieves:  Good for scouting, very nice when grouped.      Monks:    Weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.      Druids:   Medium at all levels, like clerics.      spellcasting is harder to do in combat.  generally, the more powerful    the spell, the harder to cast in combat.  magic missile, acid blast,    shocking grasp, cause light, serious, critical, are all fairly easy    to cast in combat.      While your equipment can be damaged by spells and such, there are some    things you can do minimize the damage.  #1, if you are fighting something    that does fire damage, being immune or resistant to fire yourself will    help your equipment out as well.   Good saves will also in general reduce    the amount of damage.

LINK   
A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:     I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee     each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then     you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until     you reconnect to the game.    II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution     we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By  breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.   

#
 LIST

 MONK    
Monks are a sub-class of fighters which are very quick and agile. They use various attack forms taught by Cain the monk guildmaster at the monk  monastry.  Monks concentrate on becoming harmonious not only with themselves, but with nature, giving them some advantages in fighting and, over time,  skills which reflect this harmony.  Furthermore, at very high levels, monks develop natural resistances to certain sources of damage.  Monks don't generally use weapons or shields, for they hit harder with there bare hands.  At high levels monks have been known to get up to 5 regular attacks,  

See also:  MONK DAMAGE, MONK ATTACKS 

# 
"MONK ATTACKS"  
The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk will get per round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide the probability of getting an extra attack each round. (i.e. if you were VERY lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but probably won't)   
[a few samples: Level--#Att]  1--1.00    5--1.25    9--1.50   13--1.75   17--2.00   21--2.25   25--2.50 29--2.75   33--3.00   37--3.25   41--3.50   45--3.75   49--4.00

 MOUNT RIDE RIDING     
Usage : Mount <Mount name>      
It is now possible to mount horses and dragons.. Certain aspects are not finalized, so it is not advisable to mount aggressive dragons.  Currently there are no horses of the correct race to be ridden, so, for the moment, it is only possible to ride dragons.  However, dragons are not docile creatures, and it will take a large amount of riding skill, and a high level character to do it with any amount of ability.  You can order your mount to do things, as if he/she was a follower, but he/she isn't, so you can't group with the mount.  Each time you attack something, or your mount attacks something, or each time you take damage or your mount takes damage, you have a chance of being thrown from the back of your mount.       It is easier for evil chars to ride evil dragons, and good chars to ride good dragons.       To get an idea of how powerful one has to be to ride dragons,  a 60th level character can typically only successfully ride on Yevaud if said character has a -1000 alignment, or is affected by the dragon-riding spell.  Or if yevaud is heavily damaged.

# 
MULTIPLAYING

  We can be short on this: Multiplaying is *not* allowed. Going linkdead
  with one player and logging on with another is also not allowed. If one
  is caught multiplaying, a warning is issued, and if one's caught doing
  it again, the player will get zapped (nuked, erased, you get the drift).

NEWBIE  
These are a few things that should help you get past your first few levels.   Most important:  -You start off in the Temple of Karsinya. To the east is a room   that generally has free equipment in it. To the west is a zone   designed for level 1 characters. The copper equipment is pretty   good starting gear.  -From the Temple of Karsinya, Meeting Square is s 2e 4n.   This is a central location for the town. East is the inn, and    west is the guildhall.  -People of the same race will assist each other in battles.   This means that attacking a creature when others of its kind   are around is not very wise unless you can take them all on.  -Be PATIENT, levels do not necessarily come overnight.  Fast gains   are usually risky and lead to death too often.  -If in doubt about something, ask someone.   Others:   -Cityguards and Royal Guards do jump into battles.  They will jump    in on the side of the person with the higher alignment.  All    newbies have an alignment of zero.   -Player killing is not allowed.   -Some skills you only need to invest one practice into, and then you can    improve them with use.  This especially applies to Monks and Thieves.   Mages:   -Learn Magic Missile, it helps.   Clerics:   -Avoid getting lower level version of spells if you think that you can    get to a high enough level to use a more powerful version. For example    practice cure serious instead of cure light if you can get by without    cure light.   Druids:   -Learn Tree Travel at 10th, or else you won't be able to advance past    that.   -Learn Flame Blade, or else getting past 10th will be a real pain.    If you have any comments about things you think you should see here, post them on the board, and we will see what we can do about adding them.

RULES
******* MORTAL RULES *******  
This is a list of rules for all players of Havok.  You are expected to know these rules well and follow them all the time.  Also check these rooms now  and then for any additions or changes to the rules.  

1) If you have a problem or a question please read the help files, news, and ask other mortals first before asking an immortal.  Most questions we get can be answered by another mortal.  

2) Player killing is illegal.  This includes such things as summoning a PC to the purple worm to get them killed. There is never an excuse to kill someone, if you feel a problem has reached that extend tell an immortal about it, never  take a problem into your own hands. The only exception to this are immortal sponsored Arenas, which are apart from the mud itself.  

3) Stealing from another player is illegal.  Even if you know the person and they are sitting right next to you in real life, it's still illegal.  If you must practice stealing go to a low level mob and practice.  

4) Kill stealing is illegal.  If you walk into a room that has a person and a mob in it, ask that person first if this is their mob.  If a mob looks out of place, like the beholder out of the temple of Old Thalos, do a whozone and see if the mob is being attacked by someone else before you attack it. However, there is no mob "reserving".  If you are planning on killing a mob you must do so within two minutes, you cannot just sit there reserving a mob for your group for 15 minutes.  

5) Casting harmful spells on other PC's is illegal.  This includes things  like faerie fire, hypnosis, or feeblemind.  Also using charmed mobs to attack other PC's is illegal.  Such acts are very childish and not becoming of a good mudder.  

6) Looting players corpses is illegal.  If you must get stuff from the corpse of the person make SURE you have the permission of that person first.  Then, and only then, can you get the stuff.  If there is an item in the corpse that you really want and you think that this person isn't on to ask for the item then you may get the item once the corpse has dissolved, then ONLY!  

7)  No foul language will be tolerated over public channels.  This includes words using symbols to represent certain letters in the word. If you cannot control yourself, your ability to use public channels will be disabled.  

8)  Do not whine.  This includes whining to higher levels about grouping with them, etc.  Any problems should be discussed maturely with your fellow players.  Whining just aggravates others to the point of refusing to give a character any help whatsoever.  

9)  Lag is a part of every MUD.  We understand that it can be frustrating, but in general, there is nothing we can do about it.  Whining about it only annoys everyone.  If you feel that there is a need for a wclean, feel free to ask for one in a polite and mature manner.  

10)  In general, multi-playing is illegal.  Multi-playing is the act of having more than one character logged on at one time.  The reasonning behind the lack of multi-playing allowed is that multi-playing is the easiest way to cheat, and help one's self out.  This rule includes  immortals.  Players must rent out, prior to bringing out another charector.  

11)  Above all, use common sense.  Don't act childish and you won't be treated like a child.  Any problems should be reported to an implementor. All comments will be kept confidential unless otherwise requested.  

12)  Do not share characters.  Your password is the key to safety.  It does not matter what the name of your character is, do not give your password  to anyone, enabling them to use your character, because the implementors are not  responsible for any damage done to your character in your absence, and reimbursements will not be given.  

13)  Player bots are illegal. Bots are programs that perform tasks  independent of player input. Havok is for players, not robots. If you  really feel like programming, become an immortal, we can put the effort  to better use. It is a fine line between the various aids that are  standard in most Mud clients, like triggers and autopaths, and an  automated bot. Certainly you will have to attend the keyboard while you  mud. Thus if an immortal asks for you while you are obviously active, it  would be wise for you to answer. And as a final note, Seth and  Newbieguide are -not- player bots, they are immortal sponsored, and are  not subject to this rule. 

# 
RUN    
Usage:  Run <Direction>   	
To RUN simply type 'run <dir>' where <dir> is the direction you wish to run (north,south,east,west,up,down). You will then be 'hurried' through the rooms/locations until you get to a room that does not have a exit in the direction you are running. In other words if you 'run west' you will run westwards until you get to a room without an exit west. Run requires more movement points and you must have a minimum movement.   WARNING: You CAN hit DT's this way!  See also:  DT 

# 
SAVE   
Usage : save  
Save your persona. This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.  It also saves your equipment, up to the first 200 items.  Note that you cannot go back to a save point, this only allows the mud to recover your file should in the case of a crash.  You are automatically saved every time you rent.

Also see : INN, QUIT 

# 
SAY TELL WHISPER SHOUT ASK GOSSIP REPLY   
Usage : say <text to be said>        
           : tell <PC> <text to be said>        
           : whisper <PC> <text to be said>        
           : shout <text to be said>        
           : ask <PC> <text to be said>        
           : ' <text to be said>             
If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood better if you start your sentences with either say,tell,whisper or shout.     When using SAY you speak in a language that you choose, via SPEAK. If the PC's do not understand you will not be able to communicate. All other commands (tell,gos,shout,whisper) do not use a special language.    The scope of these methods of comunications is as follows:                                
say ------> to everyone in your current room.                
tell------> Zone communication to target.                 
whisper---> to target in your current room.                
shout-----> to entire mud.                
ask-------> to target in your current room.                
reply-----> to the last person that told you something.                
gossip----> to all in your current zone.   
Special notes:   
-'shout' is very physically exhausting and will take up a bit of your mana and movement.   -'tell' will work anywhere in the mud if you are talking to an immortal.   
-'reply' is good for speaking with invisible persons who talked to you first.   
- no harrasing of players or in anyway abuse any of these channels of communication.

SHOPS    
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.  (They usually have a few thousand hitpoints and can shoot through schools).

If the victim fails the saving throw, the spell affect is removed. This spell is not hostile when cast on other Player Characters, but monsters will generally take offense at it.

Usage        :  cast 'energy restore'   
Accumulative :  -   
Duration     :  Instantaneous   
Level        :  47 Cleric    
This spell returns drained experience to its level before the drain. Lost levels must be regained at your guild master, if you had the exp for  them before the drain.  This will only work if you do not rent between the  drain and the casting of the spell.  Dropping link may also interfere with  the action of the spell.  NOTE:  This only restores total experience.  Drain does not always remove  experience, it always removes levels.  For instance:  Say Warrior was level 22, with 4,000,000 experience, and he died.  He is  still level 22, but only has 2,000,000 exp now.  He kills things for a  while, and gains some exp back up to 3,000,000 experience.  (This would be enough experience for level 18.)  At this point he gets drained two  levels to level 20.  He STILL HAS THE 3,000,000 exp!  He lost no  experience, so energy restore will do nothing.  He is now level 20 with  exp for 18, instead of level 22 with exp for 18.

Save        : None     
With this spell the cleric calls upon the aid of their deity to bring the  life force back into a dead person.  This is quite an undertaking as it will  require a sacrifice of 25,000 coins for mobs and 75,000 coins for PC's, and the beneficiary loses 1 con point permanently..after the con reaches 3, no more resurrections can occur. The calling of such help from a deity is so  draining on the cleric that the cleric will move to 1 hit point, 1 mana, and  1 movement point, also they will be stunned for a while.  Make sure you are  in a safe place before casting or else you might end up with the same fate as  your victim.  If this spell is cast upon a monster the monster becomes a loyal  follower of the cast for 36 game hours.   IMPORTANT:  The dead character has to stay OUT of the game until 	he/she is resurrected.  If he/she reenters the game, he/she 	cannot be resurrected.  All the way out. I.E. all the way out of 	telnet.  If you are at the choice menu, tough luck - you were  warned!

They are not very combat oriented, however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself. The useful aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead, avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying items at the black market.     You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

WINGS    
Avariel and a few other races have wings on their backs. Avariel in particular have large feathered wings that are vulnerable to fire. Wings only allow you to fly for an amount of time based heavily on your Constitution. Afterwards you must rest for a period of time, also based on Constitution, or have a refresh or second wind spell cast on you.    Wings may be burnt by fire spells, in which case the unfortunate victim starts to fall. They have enough control to find a close landing spot, but could be in trouble if they take a hit high in the air. Surviving Avariel can have a heal spell cast to quickly regenerate their burned wings, although they will naturally heal in time.
