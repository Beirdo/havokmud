"CLASS BARBARIAN"

    The barbarian is the beast of the fighter classes.  A barbarian
    will tend to have the most hitpoints of any character.  He or she
    doesn't trust magic at all, refusing to use any magical items.  They
    can still use most potions and scrolls.  'Berserk' is the most
    important command for this class.

    Barbarians earn between 3 and 22 hitpoints per level up to level 14.
    After that they earn 6 hitpoints per level.

    The most important attributes for a barbarian are constitution,
    strength, and dexterity.

    Barbarians can learn these skills from their guildmaster:

"CLASS CLERIC"

    The cleric is a mainstay of the basic classes.  With spells
    not duplicated by any other class in any fashion, they are
    essential to any group.  Healing and protection are the keys
    to this class, and it has very few ways to offensively damage
    an opponent.  The cleric has good access to armors, but tends
    to not be able to use any sharp weapons, only blunt ones like
    maces.  Clerics use 'mana' to cast spells, which is recovered
    gradually.  'Cast' is the most important command for this class.

    Clerics earn between 3 and 15 hitpoints per level up to level 11.
    After that they earn 3 hitpoints per level.

    The most important attributes for a cleric are wisdom, intelligence,
    and constitution.

"CLASS DRUID"

    This class is the champion of nature, they exist only to make
    sure that nature is not harmed by the degradations of
    civilization.  They must maintain a neutral alignment, but
    gain access to spells that no other class can even approximate.
    If they ever lose their neutral stance, they will become a
    normal cleric, instead of the specialized druid.  Their
    access to equipment is limited, they prefer natural armors,
    but they can still be reasonably powerful fighters.  Druids use
    'mana' to cast spells, which is recovered gradually.  'Cast' is
    the most important command for this class.

    Druids earn between 2 and 14 hitpoints per level up to level 14.
    After that they earn 3 hitpoints per level.

    The most important attributes for a druid are wisdom, intelligence,
    and constitution.

"CLASS LIST"

    There are currently 12 classes available, each can be viewed in
    detail with help class <classname>:

    Barbarian - This is a berserker, the classic bloodlust warrior
    with a distrust of magic.  Tends to be very hardy, and can
    truly annihilate opponents when they go berserk.

    Cleric - This is a follower of the gods, who can pray to them
    for powers and spells.  Typically the magic the gods grant is
    of the healing and protection variety.

    Druid - This is the guardian of nature.  Not taking the side
    of good nor evil, they can use the powers of nature to protect
    themselves and the world around them.  They have no love for
    man made things, preferring wood and leather.

    Mage - This is a practitioner of the magical arts.  By manipulating
    the fabric of the energy of the world, they can make unnatural
    feats occur regularly.  They effects they create tend to be very
    grandiose and very damaging, typically the opposite of the clerics.

    Monk - This is the consummate fighter, who believes that the human
    body and mind are the greatest weapons every created.  Martial
    arts doesn't begin to describe the incredible damage that these
    masters of combat can wreak on opponents.  They are not as hardy
    as your typical armor wearing, sword swinging warrior.

    Necromancer - This is the death worshipping magic user.  Essentially
    the opposite of a paladin in every respect.  This mage has great
    powers over the life force of individuals, draining it with ease,
    and crafting undead servants from the corpses of his fallen opponents.
    However, if the necromancer ever drifts into doing good deeds, he or
    she will lose the powers that make the necromancer so powerful.

    Paladin - This is the epitome of righteousness and virtue.  The
    paladin is the holy warrior who fights for the good people of
    the realm.  They can never slip and fall into the darkness of
    evil deeds, or they will no longer be a paladin.  The paladin's
    purity gives him or her powers that other warriors lack.  In
    almost all respects they are the necromancers opposites, one
    worships life and goodness and martial prowess, the other
    believes in death, magic and evil.

    Psionist - This is the other side of the coin of the monk class.
    Where the monk achieves discipline of the body, the psionist
    achieves discipline of the mind.  The psionist has powers that
    usually attack the mind of opponents, and also specializes in
    transportation about the realm.  While they are similar to
    normal mages, the source of their power is different, thus
    the psionist can do things that mages are incapable of.

    Ranger - This is the blend between a straight fighter and the
    druidic guardians of nature.  The ranger tends to represent
    the positive forces of man and nature, if they ever turn to
    evil, they become normal warriors, losing the benefits of
    being a ranger.  The ranger gets a few extra skills which are
    usually nature based, and is the only class which can wield
    two weapons at once.

    Sorcerer - This is a variant on the mage class.  Where a mage
    usually uses his own personal magical resources, which gives
    the mage the ability to pick the spell right as it's being
    cast, the sorcerer has to memorize specific spells, so can
    only cast spells that are prepared for casting.  However,
    once memorized, the sorcerer will not fail when he or she
    calls on the magic.

    Thief - This is the dangerous combination of ruthlessness
    and duplicity.  A thief can do all sorts of dishonest things,
    like steal, pick locks, spy, and remove traps.  In combat
    the thief doesn't like to stand toe to toe against big
    opponents with big swords.  However, if the thief can creep
    up on an opponent, they can plant a dagger in their back,
    and then the blood will flow.

    Warrior - This is your basic big, strong person wearing a lot
    of protective metal and holding a really big pointy
    piece of metal.  A generalist in destruction and mayhem,
    the warrior doesn't get any spells or magical abilities, but
    makes up for that with a great selection of gear and the
    ability to hit hard.  This is by far the most flexible of
    the fighters, with better gear than the barbarian, more
    options than the paladin, and more focussed than the ranger.

#
"CLASS MAGE"

    The mage is a mainstay of the basic classes, weak in combat, strong
    in magic.  With earth-shattering spells, the mage can be a truly
    heavy hitter, doing devastating damage to opponents.  The mage is not
    a protective caster like the cleric, instead the mage is about bringing
    a bigger stick to a fight than your opponent.  The mage has very limited
    armor and weapons available, it is expected that most of the damage
    from an opponent will be soaked up by a fighter, and the damage the
    mage does is mostly from spells. A mage uses 'mana' to cast spells, which
    is recovered gradually.  'Cast' is the most important command
    for this class.

    Mages earn between 2 and 6 hitpoints per level up to level 11.
    After that they earn 1 hitpoint per level.

    The most important attributes for a mage are intelligence, wisdom,
    and dexterity.

#
"CLASS MONK"

    This class is an offshoot of the fighter classes.  Masters of
    unarmed combat, the monk does not get the same number of hit
    points as the warrior, but can do truly remarkable damage with
    their fists.  For sheer damage, the monk is impressive, and
    with some of the special skills, they can be great support
    characters.  The monk's selection of armor and equipment tends
    to be fairly poor, but the monk's training makes up for it,
    easily.  A monk's natural 'armor class' drops as he or she
    goes up in levels, getting as good as "very well armored" and
    the damage their fists do increases as their level increases.
    Also they eventually become impervious to some effects, like hold
    spells, charm spells, and poison.  They have the most natural
    attacks of any fighter, but they can not receive 'haste' spells
    when they become immune to hold spells.  Monks have taken a vow
    of poverty, so they can not make use of the banks found throughout
    the realms.  Monks gain special bonuses when fighting using the
    'defensive' style.  'Legsweep' is the most important command for
    this class.

    Monks earn between 2 and 10 hitpoints per level up to level 16.
    After that they earn 4 hitpoints per level.

    The most important attributes for a monk are strength, constitution,
    and dexterity.

    Monks can learn these skills from their guildmaster:
    (* indicates only if Monk is selected as your Main Class)

    disarm                             legsweep
    dodge                              pick lock
    feign death                        quivering palm
    flowerfist (*)                     retreat
    flurry of blows (*)                safe fall
    hide                               sneak
    kick                               spring leap

#
"CLASS NECROMANCER"

    This class is a branch of magic that is avoided by most magic users.
    The necromancer deals almost exclusively in death, and has great
    power of the life forces of living beings and can create powerful
    undead servants.  In order to keep in touch with this magic, the
    necromancer must remain evil and dark.  The necromancer does far
    more damage to good aligned opponents than evil opponents, and
    despite having power over undead, a necromancer has a difficult
    time fighting undead.  The necromancer doesn't tend to be robust,
    and usually has a fighter standing in front to take the blows from
    opponents.  The armor available for a necromancer tends to be
    poor, and the weapon selection isn't much better, but
    the powerful magics they command tend to overshadow this fact.
    The necromancers powers spells using 'mana' which is recovered
    gradually.  'Cast' is the most important command for this class.

    Necromancers earn between 2 and 10 hitpoints per level up to level 11.
    After that they earn 2 hitpoints per level.

    The most important attributes for a necromancer are intelligence, wisdom,
    and dexterity.

"CLASS PALADIN"

    This class is the epitome of the holy warrior.  Fueled by
    faith, the paladin is a devastating foe to all evil
    creatures.  The paladin must maintain a good alignment,
    failure to do so results in a fall from grace, where the
    paladin becomes a normal average fighter.  The paladin
    does more damage to evil opponents than normal, and has
    a flurry of skills, most of which either bolster
    good aligned individuals, or blast evil aligned
    victims.  The paladin's equipment tends to be very good,
    and he or she receives a decent number of hitpoints.
    The paladin uses 'mana' to cast his spells and use some
    of his abilities, which is recovered gradually.
    'Warcry' is the most important command for this class.

    Paladins earn between 3 and 16 hitpoints per level up to level 10.
    After that they earn 4 hitpoints per level.

    The most important attributes for a paladin are strength,
    constitution, and wisdom.

"CLASS PSIONIST"

    This class represents the rare people who can tap into the
    latent power of the mind.  A psionist has powers that have
    no equivalent in the world of magic.  They can affect the
    minds of the opponents in various ways, and have a greater
    understanding of transportational theories than even the
    mages.  The powers of the psionist are unique and do not
    follow the same rules as magic.  Their equipment tends to
    be fairly poor, which is understandable given their focus
    on the mind, rather than the body.  Psionists power their
    skills and abilities with 'mana', which is recovered gradually.
    'Blast', the command for the skill 'psionic blast' is the
    most important command for this class.  The 'mind' command
    is used to access their structured abilities.

"CLASS RANGER"

    protector of nature, using swords to get the point across.

    lose his special abilities and become a warrior.  Rangers
    have several unique abilities, one of which is the ability
    to wield two weapons at once.  Called dual wielding, it
    provides an extra attack with a weapon held in the off-hand.
    Rangers tend to have a good selection of equipment and uses
    'mana' to power the nature-based spells available to the
    class.  'Bash' is the most important command of the class.

#
"CLASS SORCERER"

    The sorcerer is an offshoot of the mage class, weak in combat, strong
    in magic.  With earth-shattering spells, the sorcerer can be a truly
    heavy hitter, doing devastating damage to opponents.  The sorcerer is not
    a protective caster like the cleric, instead the sorcerer is about bringing
    a bigger stick to a fight than your opponent.  The sorcerer has very limited
    armor and weapons available, it is expected that most of the damage
    from an opponent will be soaked up by a fighter, and the damage the
    sorcerer does is mostly from spells. Rather than using 'mana' to cast spells
    a sorcerer will 'memorize' a spell, which requires sitting for a time and
    studying your spell book.  'Recall' is the most important command
    for this class.

    Sorcerers earn between 2 and 6 hitpoints per level up to level 11.
    After that they earn 1 hitpoint per level.

    The most important attributes for a sorcerer are intelligence, wisdom,
    and dexterity.

"CLASS THIEF"

    This class represents all the dirty underhanded tricks
    ever created by the most vicious and greedy minds of
    the realm.  The thief is part assassin, part burglar,
    and usually has the morals of a depraved psychotic
    kleptomaniac.  The thief has several specialized
    skills that no other class can approximate.  One
    of which is the ability to pick the locks of not
    just doors, but also containers, like chests.  Another
    is the ability to steal the rings off of fingers, and
    the coins out of purses.  The most devastating skill
    known to the thief is the ability to backstab opponents.
    Feared by all, thieves who have chosen thief as their
    main class can do absolutely devastating damage to
    an opponent with a piercing weapon.  The equipment
    a thief can wear tends to be limited to lighter armor
    and smaller weapons, and they are not meant to stand
    toe to toe with a fighter.  'Backstab' is the most
    important command of this class.

    Thieves earn between 2 and 10 hitpoints per level up to level 11.
    After that they earn 2 hitpoints per level.

    The most important attributes for a thief are dexterity,
    constitution, and strength.

#
"CLASS WARRIOR"

    This class is the classic sword swinging fighter, wearing
    lots of armor and carrying a really big sword.  This is
    the guy you want in the front of your battles, hacking
    and slashing his way through scores of enemies.  While
    possessing no magical spells, nor any particularly
    spectacular skills, the warrior is unhindered by any
    ethos claims, and can use almost any piece of equipment.
    This means that the warrior is a very versatile fighter,
    able to adapt to the needs of the moment.  'Bash' is
    the most important skill of this class.

    Warriors earn between 3 and 16 hitpoints per level up to level 9.
    After that they earn 4 hitpoints per level.

    to build a custom prompt, which is redisplayed on every newline.
    'bprompt' is the prompt that you will see in battle, you can have a
    different prompt normally using 'prompt'.  Without an argument the
    command will show your current battle prompt setup.  With a numerical
    argument between 1 and 12 and you will have a preset prompt.  The
    variable characters for building your own prompt are:
    %h = current hitpoints
    %H = max hitpoints
    %m = current mana
    %M = max mana
    %v = current move
    %V = max move
    %c = condition of tank
    %C = condition of enemy
    %g = gold on person
    %G = gold in bank
    %x = experience to next level
    %X = current experience
    %t = current mud time
    %T = current system time (currently unaccessible)
    %s = same as %S with placeholders for non-active spells
    %S = spell listing (lower case letter indicates a short lived spell effect)
        F = 'fireshield' spell
        C = 'chillshield' spell
        B = 'blade barrier' spell
        S = 'sanctuary' spell
        I = 'invisibility' spell

        D = protection from drain
        d = resistance to drain
        A = 'anti magic shell' spell
        L = 'flying' spell

    Using any text and the above variables, you can build your own specific
    prompt.  There are a number of predefined ones however, 10 being a
    popular choice, especially for caster types.

    This command is very similar to the 'bprompt' command.  It allows you
    to build a custom prompt, which is redisplayed on every newline.
    'prompt' is the prompt that you will see by default, you can have a
    different prompt in battle using 'bprompt'.  Without an argument the
    command will show your current battle prompt setup.  With a numerical
    argument between 1 and 12 and you will have a preset prompt.  The
    variable characters for building your own prompt are:
    %h = current hitpoints
    %H = max hitpoints
    %m = current mana
    %M = max mana
    %v = current move

        A = 'anti magic shell' spell
        L = 'flying' spell

    what skills you have learned and how proficient you are at them.  This
    command will also show you the skills you have not yet learned.  When
    not in the presence of a guildmaster or a trainer, you must include a
    class argument (one of the single letters) to see the skills for that
    class.  When in the presence of a guildmaster or a trainer, this command
    without an argument will show you the skills that guildmaster or trainer
    can teach.  With a skill name as an argument (such as "bash") the
    guildmaster or trainer will teach you that skill, allowing you to
    use it.  You can practice a skill multiple times to get better at it.
    Every time you practice a skill at a guildmaster or trainer it costs
    you "practices" which are the currency of skills.  You gain practices
    by advancing in level and you spend them learning skills.

"MIND CELL ADJUSTMENT"
    Castable by :  psionist 14
    Usage       :  mind 'cell adjustment'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  100
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Immensely Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    The psionist commands incredible control over his or her
    own physical shell.  Terrible wounds can be remedied by
    accelerating the body's own healing capabilities.
    However, the concentration necessary to accomplish this
    is such that the psionist is oblivious to the outside
    world while this occurs.  If there is less than 100
    points of damage to the psionist, they will be fully
    healed, but if there is more, they will still be hurt
    when they regain mobility.


#
"MIND CHAMELEON"
    Castable by :  psionist 8
    Usage       :  mind 'chameleon'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  40
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Casting this spell allows the psionist to blend into
    the background, by clouding the minds of any who might
    see him or her.  It costs the psionist a great deal
    of power to do this, and in a completely different way
    it mimics the thief skill of 'hide'.


#
"MIND CLAIRVOYANCE"
    Castable by :  psionist 8
    Usage       :  mind 'clairvoyance'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  45
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Slightly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This ability allows the psionist to see in nearby areas
    without having to be there.  Much like the spell 'wizardeye'
    used by mages, the psionist can look in a direction to get
    a perfect view of what lies in that direction.  The psionist
    consciousness is freed from his physical body, but does not
    go far, thus reducing the danger to the psionist.  The effect
    of this ability only lasts a few hours.


#
"MIND DANGER SENSE"
    Castable by :  psionist 23
    Usage       :  mind 'danger sense'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  50
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A unique ability that is only known to psionists, this allows
    the psionist to open up his mind to sense very specific dangers
    in nearby rooms.  No 'death trap' can be hidden from this ability,
    but the psionist must look in the direction of the room that
    could potentially have the trap.  It will not be able to help
    the psionist if the area isn't immediately dangerous.  The ability
    lasts a very short time, even the most powerful of psionists can
    barely maintain it for a handful of hours before needing to renew
    it.


#
"MIND DISINTEGRATE"
    Castable by :  psionist 38
    Usage       :  mind 'disintegrate' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  Level d10
    Damage Type :  Energy
    Saving Throw:  vs. Spell for 1/2 Damage
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  50
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    While not as quick as the mage's spell of disintegrate, it
    is much easier for a psionist to keep his or her
    concentration and activate this ability.  The psionist
    visualizes a chaotic force that can break the bonds between
    everything.  With complete concentration, he or she can
    turn it into a beam that flashes out towards the target.
    If the target is lucky, they can shake off some of the
    devastating effect of their very molecules splitting.
    Their equipment is also affected by this, and it could
    destroy the equipment with no sign of it ever having
    existed.

    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -

    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  30
    Casting Time:  Medium

    Acting much like the magic user's 'knock' spell, this
    allows the psionist to do delicate work using the
    ability of telekinesis.  My sending his or her mind's
    eye and telekinetic touch into a door's lock, a
    psionist can manipulate and unlock many doors.  Some
    are too complex, or are sealed magically to be opened
    in this manner.  If a psionist uses this ability on an
    unlocked door, it will be locked.

    Flying and the psionic abilities is not something
    that compares favorably with the flying spells of
    magic users.  While this ability grants the same
    benefit as a 'fly' spell, it uses telekinesis to
    lift the person.  The weight of a person is very
    difficult to hold up for a long time, so this
    ability needs renewal fairly often.  Even a very
    powerful psionist will not manage to keep a person
    aloft for very long, barely a double handful of
    hours.

    By concentrating on heat, and projecting the thought of
    fire into the minds of others, the psionist can make any
    non-allied creature in the room believe they are struck
    by blistering fire.  However, it is partially a
    hallucination, so that if a person believes they avoid
    the fire, they will take no damage.

    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This ability does the same thing as the mage spell 'feeblemind'
    except that it occurs in a completely different manner.
    'Feeblemind' imposes a magical barrier between the mage's
    actions and intellect.  'Mind wipe' will actually perform a
    neurological lobotomy on the victim.  Until the brain repairs
    itself, or some type of healing occurs, the person has
    literal brain damage.  However, the psionist actually has to
    touch the target's mind, and if they are lucky enough, they
    can prevent the surgery from occurring.  It takes a full day
    for the target to recover from this mutilation, and during this
    time, spell casting is impossible as well as psionics.  The
    'mindblank' ability is a perfect defense against this power.

"MIND MINDBLANK"

    Difficulty  :  Somewhat Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This mental ability allows the psionist to obscure parts of
    his mind with a shifting white wall of no thought.  Because
    the mind is not perceived in the expected way, it provides
    a defense against some mental assaults, both magical and
    psionic.  Since 'feeblemind' and 'mind wipe' both expect
    a certain thought pattern, this ability is a perfect defense.

"MIND PROBABILITY TRAVEL"

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This ability allows a psionist to tap into the laws of
    physics for him and his allies.  By rupturing the
    very forces that hold creatures to the plane they reside
    on, the psionist casts them free of being anywhere.  For
    a brief moment, all allies of the psionist are actually
    nowhere and nowhen.  Nature abhors this type of non-being
    and instantly ejects the creatures into a random plane.
    The psionist can control that ejection and guide the
    group onto the astral plane.  Only the astral plane can
    be found this way, any attempt to allow the random
    ejection to continue, or guide the travellers onto another
    plane has resulted in adventurers never being heard from
    again.

    The type of focus and control a psionist has over his own
    body rivals that of a monk, but in a different way.  While
    a monk might turn inward to create non-visible effects,
    such as their immunity to hold magics, a psionist has the
    power to create outward effects, such as growing visibly
    stronger.  While creating a similar effect to the mage
    spell 'strength', this ability is quite different, and can
    actually be used in conjunction with the magic spell.  It
    will last a long time, especially when used by powerful
    psionists.  Psionic Masters have been known to maintain
    this power for over four days before having to renew
    the ability.


#
"MIND PSIONIC TELEPORT"
    Castable by :  psionist 12
    Usage       :  mind 'psionic teleport' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  vs. Spell to Negate
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  15
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Similar to the 'teleport' spell, this ability can be a last
    ditch effort to avoid death.  The principle behind the ability
    is similar to the 'probability travel' skill.  The psionist
    displaces the target, but only in location, thus keeping them
    on the same plane.  As nature will not allow a person to be
    nowhere for any length of time, the victim is ejected into the
    material world, but in a random location.  The location is
    completely random, it can be anywhere on the same plane of
    existence, as long as no magical or natural barriers exist to
    prevent the translocation.  While that guarantees not ending up
    materializing inside of a boulder, it does not mean that you
    won't end up in the air above a ravine, or landing in the
    midst of a ravenous pack of wolves.  The fact that this
    spell can be cast in combat means that you might save yourself
    an agonizing death.  However, you also might jump from the
    frying pan into the fire.  If it is used on another being,
    that being can resist the displacement effect of the power,
    and remain in the same location.

"MIND PSYCHIC CRUSH"

    Usage       :  mind 'psychic crush' [<mob>]

    Difficulty  :  Slightly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    After years of training, the psionist has strengthened their
    mind to the point that they can simply overwhelm other
    untrained minds.  Much like a fighter who is so much stronger
    and bigger than another creature that he or she can manhandle
    that creature.  By simply bringing the full weight of the
    mind on an opponent, the psionist can literally break the
    victim's brain.  Physical effects of this attack may be
    bleeding from the ears, eyes, or nose.  The ability 'tower of
    iron will' can provide a great deal of protection to this
    assault.


#
"MIND PSYCHIC IMPERSONATION"
    Castable by :  psionist 3

    This skill can be useful in some situations, but the psionist
    must recognize those situations.  This ability combines half
    physical powers and half mental.  Physically the psionist
    just barely rearranges some broad aspects of his body.  This
    serves to give the psionist a somewhat generic humanoid
    appearance.  Then, as any creature comes into contact with the
    psionist, the psionist will snoop briefly into the top surface
    of the creature's thoughts and pick out a non-threatening
    disguise.  Then the psionist will make the creature see that
    disguise rather than the psionist's true shape and appearance.
    It will make any creature less likely to attack the psionist,
    and it will also make any creatures who currently hate the
    psionist forget about their hatred.  By reaching back to the
    hated thoughts of his or her former foes, the psionist shifts
    the blame from him or herself to another easily believable
    target.  A powerful psionist can maintain this ability for
    almost half of a day.

"MIND SENSE OBJECT"

    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A useful counterpart to the cleric spell 'locate object', this
    ability allows the psionist to gain some understanding of a
    specific object's location.  By attuning his or her mind to
    the perfectly formed image of the desired item, a feat requiring
    great concentration and willpower, and casting out a wide
    ranging psionic net, the psionist can actually see the place
    where the object resides.  The net will only close down on
    the specific item, and only one of the items if multiple exist.
    If the object is carried by a psionist, they can prevent the
    net from finding the item.

    By harnessing a massive reserve of psionic powers, the psionist can
    literally push things around using his or her mind.  It is easiest
    to focus on living, thinking creatures, and so this ability can
    be used to do one of two things.  By including a target creature
    and a desired direction that is open for travel, the psionist
    can push that creature from the current place towards that exit.
    This can be very useful in moving creatures out of a battle area
    before the battle starts.  It is impossible to push very large
    creatures, not even the most powerful psionist has the strength
    to move a giant.  The target can also resist the push, but it
    will not realize what exactly happened, and so will not attack
    the psionist.  The other use for this ability is during battle.
    If the psionist is fighting someone, they can use this power to
    lift the opponent in the air and quickly slam them to the ground.
    This will definitely shake up the opponent, making them unable
    to initiate any actions until they can start thinking clearly
    again.

    A powerful psionic defense, that uses the willpower of the
    psionist to essentially lock out all attempts to access
    his or her mind.  Where 'mindblank' tries to change the
    thought pattern of the psionist's mind to hide the mind,
    this skill makes no attempt at subterfuge.  It is a very
    "noisy" ability, and it practically dares opponents to
    try and mentally attack the psionist.  It provides a very
    strong defense against other psionic abilities, but
    doesn't tend to have much effect on any magical mind
    attacks.  'Psionic blast', 'psychic crush', and 'ultra
    blast' are all attacks that have a difficult time assaulting
    the mind of a psionist protected by this skill.  Even the
    most powerful of mortal psionists will only be able to
    maintain this ability for a handful of hours.

"MIND ULTRA BLAST"

    Although not expensive in terms of how much power this skill
    takes to achieve, it is much more costly in terms of how
    long it takes to create the effect properly.  Basically, by
    creating the proper frequency of psionic energy, the psionist
    can use it to scramble the brains of a large number of
    opponents.  The effect can at most be tailored to only seven
    or eight opponents at a time, achieving a frequency to affect
    more than that would possibly kill the psionist.  Because the
    frequency is somewhat generic, the victims of this ability
    can resist the effects, and a 'tower of iron will' gives
    a further resistance to it.  This skill operates on a similar
    principle to 'psionic blast', but 'psionic blast' will tailor
    the frequency to match only one victim.

    By creating a telekinetic wall of force around his or her body,
    the psionist can reduce the damage from incoming attacks.  The
    effect of this wall is to slow down the passage of blunt weapons,
    so that they do less damage than normal.  It effectively gives
    a resistance to blunt damage, which can be seen using the 
    'resist' command.  Also it might provide the psionist with some
    measure of protection against missile weapons.  This spell has
    a long duration and is something that would behoove the
    psionist to keep active at all times.

"MISC AFK"

    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping,
                   stunned, incapacitated, mortally wounded, dead

    This command serves as a flag to let other people know that you are
    not currently paying attention to the mud world.  AFK stands for
    Away From Keyboard, and is a toggle.  When it is turned on, you will
    have AFK appended to your title, and if someone directly communicates
    with you they will see that you are AFK.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You have to let the dog out.

#
"MISC ARENA"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  arena
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting

    This command is used to enter the arena for PC versus PC combat.
    Only in the arena are players allowed to hurt and kill one
    another, and the arena is only opened by the whim of the
    immortals.  The arena can be opened to all, or only to a subset
    of the players.  Typing this command will instantly transport
    you to the entry of the arena and will also dispel you of
    all spell effects, so don't cast spells until you are safely
    in the arena.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to enter the arena and win the contest.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> arena

"MISC AUCTION"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  auction <obj> [<minimum bid>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting

    This command is used to place an item up for auction.  The
    related auction command is 'bid'.  Any person may bid on the
    item, and when the auction is finished, the item is automatically
    transferred from you to the winning bidder, and likewise the
    gold is automatically transferred to you.  Only one item can
    be auctioned at a time.  If no minimum bid is specified then
    the first bid can be 1 gold piece.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to auction the new helmet you found.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> auction helmet 1000
    Havok>  Auction:  Rathgar auctions a shiny helmet.  Minimum bid set at
            1000 coins.

#
"MISC BEHEAD"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  behead <corpse obj>

    This command will chop off the head of a corpse, providing a
    grisly trophy.  You must be wielding a weapon that slashes or
    cleaves, blunt and piercing weapons can not behead a corpse.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to desecrate your fallen orc opponent.

#
"MISC BID"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  bid <gold amount | ?>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting

    This command is used to bid on the currently auctioned item, which
    is submitted using the 'auction' command.  Any
    amount can be tendered, but it will only be accepted if the
    new bid is at least 5% more than the current bid.  To discover
    the stats of the auctioned item you use "bid ?", so you know
    what you are getting into.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to bid on the helmet being auctioned.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> bid 1000
    Havok>  Auction:  Rathgar places a bid of 1000 coins for a shiny helmet.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to verify the helmet does what you think it does.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> bid ?

    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping,
                   stunned, incapacitated, mortally wounded, dead

    This command will toggle whether you see a newline after the mud
    sends you information.  A leftover from the days when people had
    very slow dialup accounts and sending anything extra was not
    desirable.  The default is to have compact mode off.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to have no blank lines in your output.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> compact

    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping

    This command will change how the mud displays information to you at
    the telnet level.  The 0 option will make terminal emulation very
    plain, 1 will change it to the default of VT100 terminal emulation.
    VT100 is recommended for the greatest functionality and enjoyment.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to return your display to VT100 emulation.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> display 1

    (which is the default) then you will see: "You say 'Hello'".  If
    you have echo turned off you will not see anything but a new prompt.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to stop seeing your own communications, you know
    what you said.

    Positions   :  mounted, standing

    This command is used by the leader of a clan to remove a member from
    the roster.  They must be in the room with you at the time, so it
    can only be done face to face.  This is the opposite of 'induct'.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to kick Joe out of your evil clan, for being too nice.

"MISC PRAY"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  pray <immortal> <text>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting

    This command, which becomes more likely to succeed as you gain
    levels, allows you to implore the gods for favors.  While there
    is technically no limit to the immortal's power, what they are
    willing to grant is limited.  Typical prayers can be for a
    common potion, that must be quaffed immediately, minor guidance
    on the area you are in, or some piece of technical information
    about yourself.  Sometimes your prayer fails to reach the ears
    of the immortals and sometimes your prayer does not please them
    and will not be fulfilled.  Do not tempt fate by complaining
    about your prayer.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You need a blade barrier potion before you can attack the
    mob in the next room.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> pray Jane I need a razor potion so that

#
"MISC QUEST"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  quest
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting

    This command is a toggle to indicate your willingness to join the
    current immortal-run quest.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to join in on the current quest.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> quest
    Havok>  Okay, you're now part of the quest!

#
"MISC QUI"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  qui
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping,
                   stunned, incapacitated, mortally wounded, dead

    This command is a placeholder, it does not do anything besides force
    people to type out "quit" to successfully quit from the game.  See
    the 'quit' command.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You would never intentionally do this command, but...
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> qui
    Havok>  You have to write quit - no less, to quit!

#
"MISC QUIT"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  quit [<now>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, sitting, resting, sleeping

    This command, which is not recommended for normal usage will instantly
    remove your character from the game.  However, it only removes your
    character, all the equipment of your character drops to the ground
    at the spot you quit from.  The correct way to leave the game is to
    'rent' out at an inn, which saves your equipment.  To prevent
    accidental usage of this command, the argument "now" is needed after
    "quit" to successfully use this command.  You can not use this command
    to avoid dying in combat.  The only time it is correct to use this
    command is when you have been the victim of a bug that has left you
    completely naked.  In that case, you are entitled to a reimburse from
    the immortals, but they can only do that if you do not rent out again.
    Since the bug leaves you completely naked, it should not be a problem
    to quit at that time.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You have lost all your equipment due to a crash bug and
    need to wait for a immortal to reimburse you.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> quit now

    arrows on it.

#
"MISC REMORT"
    Usable by   :  All 50
    Usage       :  remort <new class>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing

    This command has not been fully implemented but the idea is this:
    When you have mastered your current class(es) you can accept a new
    challenge in starting over again in a related class.  There are
    several limitations regarding this, but until the idea has been
    implemented, that's all you need to know.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You have reached the pinnacle of power and wish to start
    again as a different class.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> remort thief

    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping

    This command allows you to determine the size of the output screen you
    wish to view, using the default VT100 terminal, which can be set
    using the 'display' command.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):

    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> resize 45

#
"MISC REST"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  rest
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, sitting, resting

    This command will cause you to sit back and relax.  While resting
    you will regenerate hitpoints, mana, and move more quickly than
    you would standing.  This position is more restful than sitting
    and less than sleeping.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You want to rest so that you can regain mana faster.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> rest
    Havok>  You sit down and rest your tired bones.

#
"MISC RETURN"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  return
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, sitting, resting

    This command is very necessary for polymorphed players.  Using
    this will make you return back into your natural form.

    normal body shape.

#
"MISC SAVE"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  save
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping,
                   stunned

    This command is done automatically on a periodic basis by the mud, but
    if you wish to make sure that your file is completely up to date, you
    can use this command.  By using it, your player is written out to the
    hard drive of the server.  So even if the mud crashes suddenly, you
    only lose what happened between your last save and the crash.  In
    general you might want to use this when something big happens to your
    character, such as a gained level or you find a great piece of
    equipment.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You found a wand of meteor swarm.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> save

    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping,
                   stunned, incapacitated, mortally wounded, dead

    This command is a catch all for various types of flags that are used.
    There are some flags which are handled differently than normal:

    cloak - This allows you to cover up some of your equipment with whatever
    clothing you wear about your body.  If you wish to maintain some secrecy
    about your gear, this flag helps.  It does not require an "enable" or
    a "disable" qualifier.

    groupname - This flag requires an argument after it of the desired
    group name for your current group if you are the leader.  So the
    usage of this would be: set groupname The Go-Getters

    email - This flag has two settings: "disable" will remove any email
    address registered for the character.  Anything besides "disable"
    will be assumed to be your chosen email address.

    The rest of the flags require an "enable" or "disable" after the flag
    name to set or unset the flag.

    sound - This has not been implemented yet.

    private - This has not been implemented yet.

    ansi - This will determine whether you see ANSI colors in the
    text that is sent to you by the mud.

    color - This will determine whether you see ANSI colors in the
    text that is sent to you by the mud.

    oldcolors - This will determine whether you see the older style of
    ANSI colors in the text that is sent to you.

    oldschool - This will determine whether you see the older style of
    ANSI colors in the text that is sent to you.

    pause - This will determine whether the page control interface is
    used for long passages of mud information, such as lists.

    autoexits - This will determine if the exits are automatically
    displayed with the name of the room they lead to, as though you
    typed the 'exits' command.

    autosplit - This will determine if you automatically split any
    gold you recover with the members of your group.  Can also be
    accessed by the 'autosplit' command.

    autoloot - This will determine if you automatically try to get
    all from the corpse of any opponent you kill.  Can also be
    accessed by the 'autoloot' command.

    autoassist - This will determine if you automatically assist
    the other members of your group in combat.  See the 'assist'
    command.

    advice - This will determine if you hear periodic advice,
    geared towards newbies.

    war - This is an old version of a p-kill environment and is no
    longer implemented.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You want to turn off newbie advice.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> set advice disable
    Havok>  Turning newbie help OFF.

    Usage       :  sharpen <sharp weapon obj>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting

    This command does not do anything normally, but if you were to
    come across the correct equipment, like a sharpening stone, it
    might be used to bring a nice edge to a cutting weapon.  Wouldn't
    be much use on a blunt weapon like a mace.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You want to use a sharpening stone to make your sword much
    sharper.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> sharpen long-sword

    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  sit
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting

    This command changes your position to sitting.  While sitting
    you will regenerate hitpoints, mana, and move faster than while
    standing, but not as fast as if you were resting.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You want to take a seat and put up your feet for a minute.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> sit
    Havok>  You sit down.

    you will regenerate hitpoints, mana, and move faster than any
    other position, but of course you won't be able to interact much
    with the world around you.  To stop sleeping, you must issue the
    'wake' command.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You want to sleep a few hours to regain your strength.

    you can undertake most actions, it is considered the default
    position.  You regenerate hitpoints, mana and move faster than
    you would in combat, but not as fast as if you were sitting,
    resting, or sleeping.  While sleeping, you must 'wake' up
    before you can stand.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):

                   intelligence | wisdom>

    cancel an invisibility spell permanently, but will only cause
    an invisibility item to cease to function for a short time.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: A shopkeeper won't sell you a loaf of bread because he can't
    see you.

    the second usage of 'enter' is far more common.  Usually

    however.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):

#
"MOVE LAND"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  land
    Positions   :  mounted, standing

    This command is used while flying, it's purpose is to stop flying.
    This is particularly useful when travelling a great deal indoors,
    as flying indoors takes more effort that walking.  Outdoors, flying
    is generally a less taxing way of getting about.  If this command
    is used while under the influence of a 'fly' spell, it cancels the
    spell.  If used while you are wearing a fly item, it will merely
    negate the flight until you decide to start flying again using the
    'launch' command.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to stop flying because you are about to enter into
    an extensive tunnel warren.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> land
    Havok>  You start walking, in spite of your fly item.

#

    if you are wearing an item that grants flight.  By using this
    command you will resume flying, until you use the command 'land'
    or until you remove the flying item.  Flying is generally less
    tiring than walking, except while indoors.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You wish to start flying again after walking through an
    extensive tunnel warren.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> launch
    Havok>  You leap into the air with graceful ease.

"NEWBIE BARBARIAN"

    For a quick overview of who the barbarian is, type "help class
    barbarian".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this brutal class.

    'Practice' and get good at the skill 'bash'.

    The barbarian's gear is very difficult to come by, don't be
    discouraged if it feels like you can not pick up a lot of
    good looking items.

    You have a lot of 'hitpoints', don't be afraid to spend them
    during a fight, you will outlast opponents.

    Be careful using the skill 'berserk', you can not flee from
    a battle after berserking, don't bite off more than you can
    chew.

    The barbarian guildmaster in the town of Karsinya is
    in the Guild Halls to the west of the Meeting Square.
    From the Temple of Karsinya, the barbarian guildmaster is

#
"NEWBIE CLERIC"

    For a quick overview of who the cleric is, type "help class
    cleric".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this healing class.

    Do research on your spells before you 'practice' them, you
    might not want to 'practice' a weaker version of a spell if
    you can learn a more powerful version later, like the 'cure
    light' and 'cure serious' spells.

    When you learn a brand new spell, it is very expensive to
    'cast'.  As you gain levels, it will drop in cost, so the
    thing to do is to pretend you don't have that spell
    for a while.

    Try not to 'cast' healing spells during combat, it is very
    difficult to do so, and it is more likely to waste your
    'mana' than heal yourself or your target.

    When you can learn the spell 'animate dead' it might be
    worth it, you can use the zombie as a buffer between you
    and your opponents.

    Clerics really take off after level 26, so don't be
    discouraged if you struggle early on.

    The cleric guildmaster in the town of Karsinya is in
    the Guild Halls to the west of the Meeting Square.

"NEWBIE DRUID"

    For a quick overview of who the druid is, type "help class
    druid".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this nature guardian.

    Do research on your spells before you 'practice' them, you
    might not find every spell to be equally as useful, especially
    if you don't need a weaker version of a spell and can wait
    for the more powerful version, like the 'cure light' and
    'cure serious' spells.

    When you learn a brand new spell, it is very expensive to
    'cast'.  As you gain levels, it will drop in cost, so the
    thing to do is to pretend you don't have that spell
    for a while.

    Learn 'flame blade' when you get the opportunity.

    Be careful of your alignment, if you become too good or
    too evil, you lose your druidic powers, permanently.

    When you start being able to summon creatures to serve you,
    use them as buffers between yourself and your opponents.

    The druid guildmaster is inside the King's Grove in the northeast
    corner of town.  Go east from Market Square to inside the
    Eastern Gate, then head north into the King's Grove and she
    is in the eastern part.  From the Temple of Karsinya
    the druid guildmaster is s2e3n3e5nen

    When you reach level 10, you must start to duel with another
    druid to gain your next level.  You can find that challenge
    area in the large tree, all the way west of town.

"NEWBIE GENERAL"

    Welcome to mudding.  Derived from the pencil and paper
    versions of popular role playing games, this is a place
    where you can interact in real time with people from
    all over the globe in a fantasy setting.  The rules
    of how to play are governed by a program run on a
    computer rather than by a game master, or dungeon
    master.  You type commands, the program (usually
    referred to in general as the "mud") interprets what
    you typed, and it processes the information, inserting
    your action into the world.  Most of the commands
    are very intuitive, here are some basics to get you
    started (type the words in the double quotes and hit enter).

    To look around the room you are in type "look"
    To pick up a dagger that is lying in the room with you type "get dagger"
    To see your personal information type "score"
    To move about, type the first letter from a cardinal direction, such
        as: "n" for north, or "e" for east, or "u" for up.
    To see who is on the mud with you, type "who"

    Anytime you feel confused, feel free to "yell help me! I'm new!"
    The help is fairly extensive, type "help help help" to get
    information on how to best use it.
    There are help topics written for each character class for new
    players, try "help newbie " then your character class.  If you
    are a warrior, you would type "help newbie warrior".

    A full listing of the help topics available for new players can
    be found at "help newbie list", and a small map of the main
    town can be found at "help newbie map".  Directions to places
    is listed in speedwalk terminology, which looks like this:
    s2e4neu
    That translates to take go "south" once, go "east" twice, go
    "north" 4 times, go "east" once, and "up" once.  This is a
    very convenient way of expressing directions to other people.

    If you ever get very lost and confused try using the
    "recallhome" command to bring you back safely to town.

    When you are ready to end your visit, you should find an Inn
    to stay at while you are gone.  The Inn in Karsinya is just
    east and up from the Meeting Square.

    Have fun, enjoy yourself.

"NEWBIE MAGE"

    For a quick overview of who the mage is, type "help class
    mage".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this magic casting class.

    Do research on your spells before you 'practice' them, if
    a spell doesn't seem immediately useful, think about whether
    you want to learn it right now.  There is always time to learn
    it later if you change your mind.

    When you learn a brand new spell, it is very expensive to
    'cast'.  As you gain levels, it will drop in cost, so the
    thing to do is to pretend you don't have that spell
    for a while.

    'Magic missile' is the workhorse of the mage.  It has
    excellent damage potential, is fast to 'cast', and doesn't
    cost much 'mana'.  Get good at this spell and use it
    often.

    Try to find someone who will stand and get hit by your
    opponents, while you 'cast' spells safely from behind them.

    The early levels are difficult, but mages become extremely
    powerful in the later levels, so be patient and careful.

    The mage guildmaster in the town of Karsinya is in
    the Guild Halls to the west of the Meeting Square.

"NEWBIE MONK"

    For a quick overview of who the monk is, see "help class
    monk".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this martial arts master.

    While you can wield weapons as a monk, you are almost
    certainly better off using your fists.  Maybe for the
    first few levels you could use a weapon.

    'Legsweep' is a very useful skill, learn it well.

    Be careful of the fights you get into, if an opponent
    requires a magic weapon to hit them and you are not
    experienced enough, you will not be able to hit them
    with your fists.  Eventually, you can hit anything,
    but if you find yourself missing all the time in a
    fight, you might be experiencing this difficulty.

    Learn 'dodge', it's effects aren't very noticeable, but
    they add up over time.

    When you reach 10th level you must win a duel with another
    monk to advance in level.

    The monk guildmaster is outside the town of Karsinya in
    the Monk Monastery to the northwest of the town.

"NEWBIE NECROMANCER"

    For a quick overview of who the necromancer is, see "help class
    necromancer".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this death mage.

    'Life tap' is a fantastic spell, which you should master as soon
    as you are able.

    As soon as you can start creating the undead, you should use them
    as fodder for your battles.

    Fight good aligned opponents, you receive significant damage
    bonuses against them, and significant penalties for fighting
    evil opponents.

    If you end up with over 100% of your hitpoints from 'life tap'
    and similar spells, use those hitpoints wisely, when the next
    'tick' occurs, you lose those excess hitpoints.

    The necromancer guildmaster in the town of Karsinya is in
    the Guild Halls to the west of the Meeting Square.

"NEWBIE PALADIN"

    For a quick overview of who the paladin is, see "help class
    paladin".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this righteous warrior.

    Learn and master the spell 'cure light' because you don't
    receive another healing spell for a long time.

    'Holy strength', 'holy armor', and 'aura of power' are
    truly incredible abilities for the paladin, learn and use
    them as soon as you can.

    Fight evil aligned opponents, you receive significant damage
    bonuses against them, and significant penalties for fighting
    good opponents.

    Use 'call steed' when you are travelling from one place to
    another, it will save you 'move', and when needed, the
    mighty steed will fight for you.

    Learn and use 'spot', it makes adventuring much easier.

"NEWBIE PSIONIST"

    For a quick overview of who the psionist is, see "help class
    psionist".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this mental master.

    Learn and master the skill 'psionic blast', it is the most
    effective battle skill you will ever learn.

    Keep 'psi shield' up all the time, it provides good protection
    and improves as you gain levels.

    You learn 'doorway' early, use it when you know where you are
    going to save 'move'.  If you want to return to town, "doorway
    Zifnab" is a popular target.

    By the time you reach 15th level and learn 'flame shroud' you
    will probably be strong enough to start adventuring in Oblivion,
    a zone that is to the north of Karsinya.  Find the Shatterwood
    Forest and head north from there.  Oblivion has some very
    interesting equipment that only psionists can use.

    The psionist guildmaster in the town of Karsinya is in
    the Guild Halls to the west of the Meeting Square.

"NEWBIE RANGER"

    For a quick overview of who the ranger is, see "help class
    ranger".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this nature warrior.

    Start to 'practice' 'dual wield' as soon as you can, so that you
    get your learning done early.

    'Bash' is your standard combat skill, so use it often.

    Fight evil aligned opponents, you receive significant damage
    bonuses against them.

    Practice and use 'spot', it makes adventuring much easier.

"NEWBIE SORCERER"

    For a quick overview of who the sorcerer is, see "help class
    sorcerer".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this spell hurler.

    Do research on your spells before you 'practice' them, if
    a spell doesn't seem immediately useful, think about whether
    you want to learn it right now.  There is always time to learn
    it later if you change your mind.

    When you learn a brand new spell, it takes a very long time to
    'memorize'.  As you gain levels, it will get faster, so the
    thing to do is to pretend you don't have that spell
    for a while, or be willing to sit a long time.

    'Magic missile' is the workhorse of the mage.  It has
    excellent damage potential, is fast to 'recall', and doesn't
    take long to 'memorize'.  Get good at this spell and use it
    often.

    Try to find someone who will stand and get hit by your
    opponents, while you 'recall' spells safely from behind them.

    The early levels are difficult, but sorcerers become extremely
    powerful in the later levels, so be patient and careful.

#
"NEWBIE THIEF"

    For a quick overview of who the thief is, see "help class
    thief".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this backstabbing lowlife.

    'Backstab' is your friend, 'backstab' is your only friend.
    Learn it, get great at it.

    Use 'spy' often, it is difficult to get better at it, so
    the more often you try it, the faster you can learn it.

    Get used to having to 'flee', especially if you miss a
    'backstab'.  After you flee you will attempt to 'hide'
    automatically, so that if the opponent comes looking
    for you, you are ready to  'backstab' again.

    Do not be disappointed if you die, thieves tend to have
    low experience point requirements for levels, and can
    regain lost experience quickly.

    the Guild Halls to the west of the Meeting Square.

"NEWBIE WARRIOR"

    For a quick overview of who the warrior is, see "help class
    warrior".  Below are some strategies and tips for playing
    this sword swinger.

    'Bash' your way to victory, it is your primary combat skill,
    learn it and get good at it, it is valuable.

    Keep several weapons on hand, that way you can quickly 'draw'
    a new weapon if you are not having success with your current
    one and if you get 'disarm'ed, you don't have to waste time
    picking up the disarmed weapon.

    Early on, focus on finding items that have bonuses to 'hitroll'
    and armor.  Later in your career you can focus more on 'damroll'.

    When possible, practice 'rescue', because eventually you are
    going to save some poor magic user's life with that skill.

    have special effects, such as staves and wands.  If you are holding
    a staff or wand object, you can 'use' it to generate it's effect.
    Each staff or wand will have a different usage, so the targeting
    of the effect is determined by the spell cast by the object.

"RACE DARK DWARF"

    This race is one of the evil races of the realms, which
    means that good aligned guards and protectors will attack
    them on sight.  Coming from the Underdark, they have
    infravision, and can be very hardy, gaining a +1 bonus to
    constitution.  However, their stature makes them
    less nimble and have a -1 penalty to dexterity.  Coming from
    the darkness also leaves an imprint on their manners, they
    will never be the most charismatic of individuals.  They tend
    to only focus on a couple roles, see 'help race class combinations'.

"RACE DROW ELF"

    This race is one of the evil races of the realms, which
    means that good aligned guards and protectors will attack
    them on sight.  Coming from the Underdark, they have
    infravision, and tend to be very agile, gaining a +2 bonus
    to dexterity, but not very hardy, having a -1 penalty to
    constitution.  And the culture of the Underdark means that
    they do not mix well with other people, so are less
    charismatic with a -1 penalty.  They excel in the magic arts,
    see 'help race class combinations' for a complete listing

"RACE DWARF"

    This race is one of the basic fundamentals of the world.
    The hardy dwarf, who is as sturdy as the mountain, gaining a
    +1 bonus to constitution.  However, being a dwarf also means
    that dexterity suffers from their short stature with a -1
    penalty.  While they have no natural disadvantages for their
    charisma, the general dwarven nature means that they will
    never be as charismatic as is possible for other races.  See

"RACE FOREST GNOME"

    This race is the most common gnome race, with strong ties
    to nature.  Even the elves respect the empathy these
    creatures have with the forest, and they share the gift
    of infravision as well.  Their stature and life
    style lends them to be quick, gaining a +1 bonus to
    dexterity and wise, gaining a +1 bonus to wisdom, but they
    do not pursue the intellectual arts and thus take a -1 penalty
    to their intelligence, nor are interested in being
    the strongest creature of the forest, with a -1 penalty to
    strength.  They tend to gravitate to classes that deal with
    nature, see 'help race class combinations'.

#
"RACE GOBLIN"

    This race is one of the weaker races, and in many respects
    resembles the halfling race.  Naturally vicious and
    lacking in magic arts, this race is quick and nimble, gaining
    a +1 bonus to dexterity, but lacks the size to be very strong,
    a -1 penalty to strength.  The quickness makes them ideal
    thieves, and their attitude allows them to advance
    quite far as a warrior as well, see 'help race class
    combinations'.

"RACE GOLD ELF"

    This race is one of the sub-races of elves, considered to be
    the elite of the society.  Considered flighty, they have a
    -1 penalty to wisdom and are not very hardy, with a -1 penalty
    to constitution.  However, their intellect when focussed is
    considerable, granting a +1 bonus to intelligence, and are very
    nimble, like most elves, gaining a +1 bonus to dexterity.  While
    they come from the high stratus of elven society, they excel at
    base thievery naturally, and many choose to combine their magical
    arts with the arts of the underworld.  See 'help race class

"RACE HALF-ELF"

    This race is the result of rare interbreeding between elves
    and humans.  Usually considered out of place in both societies,
    they have lost some of their elven attributes, but gained some
    of the size and hardiness of the human race.  Their upbringing
    gives them a strong sense of character, they make excellent
    rangers and paladins.  However, those that become bitter often
    turn towards thievery.  See 'help race class combinations' for
    more details.

"RACE HALF-GIANT"

    This race is one of the largest "civilized" races in the realms.
    While called "Half"-Giant, they are not the product of any
    bizarre mingling of giants and humans.  They are their own race,
    noted for their immensity and physical prowess.  They receive a
    +2 bonus to strength, and a +1 bonus to constitution, but they
    tend to be slow, both physically and mentally, suffering a -1
    penalty to dexterity, intelligence, and wisdom.  With their
    size and strength, they excel at the warrior arts, see 'help
    race class combinations' for more information.

"RACE HALFLING"

    This race is one of the smallest of the realms, noted for their
    lack of moral scruples, but mostly in a light hearted way.
    Exceptionally quick, they receive a +1 bonus to dexterity, but
    also receive a -1 penalty to strength due to their small stature
    and sedentary ways.  While they can do other things, the majority
    of halflings you meet will be thieves of some kind, and usually
    quite skilled at it.  See 'help race class combinations' for more
    details.

#
"RACE HALF-OGRE"

    This race results from the usually violent unions of ogres and
    humans.  They gain some of the size of their ogre parentage, but
    also the civilizing influences of their human parent.  The size
    grants them a +1 bonus to strength and constitution, but also a
    -1 penalty to dexterity.  The limited brain power of the typical
    ogre is passed down as well, resulting in a -1 to intelligence.
    Overall, the half-ogre makes a powerful warrior, and has some
    understanding of the clerical arts.  See 'help race class
    combinations' for more details.

"RACE HALF-ORC"

    This race has both orc and human parents, resulting in a fairly
    ugly, large human-like looking child.  Growing very tall, their
    weight does not quite keep up, resulting in a gangling look.
    Their orc heritage grants a +1 bonus to their constitution, while
    also making them fairly ugly by human standards, creating a -1
    penalty to charisma.  They tend to be decent warriors, mediocre
    clerics and good thieves.  See 'help race class combinations' for
    more details.

    bonus to dexterity, but also the frailness, taking a -1
    penalty to constitution.  They tend towards magic and nature,
    similar to the gold elves in what professions they choose.

"RACE ORC"

    This race is usually a scourge upon the realms, but
    occasionally an orc decides to leave his or her tribe
    and take up adventuring.  They are sizable, gaining a
    +1 to strength and a +1 bonus to constitution, but also
    ending up with a -2 penalty to charisma due to the fact
    that they are an orc.  Also they have a -1 penalty to
    intelligence, due to their lack of civilization.  They
    don't tend to really be incredibly talented at anything,
    but make decent thieves and barbarians, see 'help race

"RACE ROCK GNOME"

    This race tends to live in mountainous regions, without
    much contact with the outside world.  Despite this, they
    are pleasant companions, but terribly lacking in common
    sense.  They are bright, with a +1 bonus to intelligence
    but don't temper that intelligence with wisdom very often,
    having a -1 penalty to wisdom.  Their magical prowess is
    strong, and even with the wisdom penalty make excellent
    mages and clerics.  See 'help race class combinations' for
    more details.

"RACE SEA ELF"

    This race is rarely seen, but hails from the deep oceans
    of the world.  It is likely the are not considered true
    elves anymore, having adapted so well to the underwater
    environs.  However, they share the look of the surface
    elves, but do not share their quickness.  The constant
    swimming they do has made them stronger than one would
    expect, granting a +1 bonus to strength, but they do
    seem to have the elven characteristic lack of hardiness,
    with a -1 penalty to constitution.  They excel at many
    professions, similar to the surface elves.  See 'help
    race class combinations' for more details.

#
"RACE TROLL"

    This race is barely on the borderline of being civilized
    enough to be considered an adventuring companion.  The
    troll is not "half"-anything, this is a troll that by
    some miracle manages to be acceptable to society.  However,
    most guards do not see it as such, and will attack any
    troll they come across.  Incredibly lanky, the troll is
    wiry and rubbery, they do not seem to be healthy and strong
    but trolls gain much the same attributes as half-giants.  A
    bonus to strength of +2 and a constitution bonus of +1.  Being
    a troll it is not surprising that they suffer a -1 penalty to
    dexterity, intelligence and wisdom.  They excel at combat and
    actually have a rudimentary faith system that allows them
    mediocre cleric power.  See 'help race class combinations' for
    more details.

"RACE WILD ELF"

    This race is the elvish race closest to nature.  They do not
    build cities, but rather keep to a tribal lifestyle, constantly
    moving.  A lack of focus on the intellectual arts has given
    them a -1 penalty to wisdom and intelligence, but the harshness
    of their existence gives them a +1 bonus to strength, and they
    have the elven nimbleness in full measure, with a +1 bonus to
    dexterity.  They make excellent druids and warriors.  See 'help

#
"SHOP SELL"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  sell <obj>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing

    This command can be used in a store to sell an item from your inventory
    to the storekeeper.  Storekeepers usually only buy certain types of
    items and they might not have enough money to purchase really expensive
    items.  Other commands used are 'list' and 'buy'.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You have an extra dagger you want to sell to the weapons
    shopkeeper.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> sell dagger
    Havok>  You just sold a dagger for 10 coins.

#
"SHOP SELL"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  value <obj>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing

    This command can be used in some stores to get the price that a
    shopkeeper would purchase an item from you for.  Useful if you
    are not sure if you want to sell an item or not.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You have an extra dagger you want to sell to the weapons
    shopkeeper.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> value dagger
    Havok>  the shopkeeper tells you 'I'll give you 10 gold coins for that!'

#
"SHOP WITHDRAW"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  withdraw <number>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting

    This command is used in a bank to take out some of your saved
    gold.  You can not withdraw more gold than you have stored in the
    bank.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You are standing in the bank and wish to take out some gold.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> withdraw 50000
    Havok>  Thank you.
            Your balance is 50000.

#
"SKILL ADRENALIZE"
    Usable by   :  psi 20
    Usage       :  adrenalize <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  15

    This skill is used by the psionist to send the target creature into a
    barely controlled frenzied state.  It will boost the strength of the
    target, and make them hit harder at the cost of losing some accuracy.
    It lasts for a handful of hours.

#
"SKILL AURA"
    Usable by   :  psi 5
    Usage       :  aura
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  40

    This skill is used by the psionist to allow him or her to see the
    auras of the creatures he or she encounters.  Magical auras and
    the morality auras become visible to the naked eye.  A white aura
    surrounding an individual means they are basically good in nature,
    while a red aura means they are evil.  A blue aura will surround
    any magical item.  No aura would indicate that the creature doesn't
    lean towards good or evil.  This can last a very long time, over
    four days if the psionist is very powerful.

#
"SKILL AVOID BACKATTACK"
    Usable by  :  barb 1
    Usage      :  -
    Positions  :  standing, fighting
    Speed      :  -
    Mana       :  0

    This skill allows a barbarian to avoid the sneaky backstab of
    a thief.  The preternatural senses of the barbarians can make
    a thief scream in frustration.  Eventually, the barbarian will
    become so adept at this as to make the backstab useless against
    him or her.

#
"SKILL BACKSTAB"
    Usable by   :  thief 1,
    Usage       :  backstab <mob>
    Positions   :  standing
    Speed       :  Single Class Thief: Medium
                   Multi-Class Thief: Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is the primary combat tactic of the thief.  Attacking
    by surprise from behind, the thief can inflict a hideous amount
    of damage in one blow.  However, once the attack has happened,
    the thief then fights like any other fighter.  The thief must
    be wielding a piercing weapon of some kind, a dagger is the
    usual object of choice.  The thief can not backstab somebody
    who is much bigger than they are, and will have a hard time
    backstabbing somebody if there is a lot of fighting going on
    around the target.

#
"SKILL BASH"
    Usable by   :  warrior 1, ranger 1, pal 1, barb 1
    Usage       :  bash [<mob>]
    Positions   :  standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is the primary combat tactic of the fighting classes.
    By rushing forward and slamming an opponent to the ground, the
    fighter can stun the opponent for a brief period of time.  While
    stunned, the opponent can not undertake any actions and will
    suffer slightly more damage than if they were standing.  Until
    the opponent stands up again, there are very few actions they
    can effectively pursue.  The fighter has to spend some time
    recovering from the slamming, and if things work out correctly,
    they will recover about the same time the opponent stops being
    stunned.  If there are many people fighting close to the target
    the fighter will have a hard time getting close enough to bash
    the target.  Also an opponent who is significantly larger than
    the fighter will be impossible to bash.  If there is no target
    specified, the fighter will bash the current opponent.

#
"SKILL BELLOW"
    Usable by   :  warrior 1, barb 1
    Usage       :  bellow
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  15

    This skill is used to startle the other creatures in the room.
    There is a chance that the bellow will stun an opponent, or
    make them flee.  If the opponent is made of sterner stuff, they
    will merely get mad at the bellower.  If a single class warrior
    does the bellow, it will act like a 'bash' on all the opponents.

#
"SKILL BERSERK"
    Usable by   :  barb 1
    Usage       :  berserk
    Positions   :  fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  15

    This skill is the primary combat skill of the barbarian.  With
    this skill the barbarian launches himself into a incredible
    whirlwind of destruction while already fighting.  He or she gets
    more attacks and hits much harder.  His or her aim suffers a
    little, and he or she can't possibly think of anything as weak
    as retreating, but in the meantime, the destructive ability is
    unparalleled.

#
"SKILL PSIONIC BLAST"
    Usable by   :  psi 1
    Usage       :  blast [<mob>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  25

    This skill is the primary combat skill of psionists.  A basic mental
    assault to the target, it will scramble the brains, causing physical
    damage.  At higher levels, the psionist can severely impair the combat
    abilities of a target.  At the pinnacle of psionist power, the target
    could even end up a vegetable, unable to even try to fight back.

#
"SKILL BLESSING"
    Usable by   :  pal 1
    Usage       :  blessing <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  level * 2

    This skill is a special set of powers, only granted by the paladin's
    deity once every three days.  The higher level the paladin and the
    more pure the target creature, the greater the blessing bestowed.
    At a very minimum the target will receive the basic low level cleric
    spells, such as 'bless' and 'armor'.  As the power of the blessing grows
    so does it's effects, which are cumulative, the most powerful blessings
    will grant multiple 'heal' spells and a 'sanctuary' spell.

#
"SKILL BREW"
    Usable by   :  sorc 1, mage 1
    Usage       :  brew '<spell>'
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  normal cost of spell * 2

    This skill allows a mage or a sorcerer to create a potion of some
    spell that he or she already is able to cast.  Not all spells are
    able to be brewed, and the cost of the brewed spell is twice the
    normal cost of the spell.  If the potion is created successfully,
    then the potion can be quaffed by anybody to receive the effect
    of the spell.

#
"SKILL BS"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  bs <mob>
    Positions   :  standing
    Speed       :  Single Class Thief: Medium
                   Multi-Class Thief: Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is the primary combat tactic of the thief.  Attacking
    by surprise from behind, the thief can inflict a hideous amount
    of damage in one blow.  However, once the attack has happened,
    the thief then fights like any other fighter.  The thief must
    be wielding a piercing weapon of some kind, a dagger is the
    usual object of choice.  The thief can not backstab somebody
    who is much bigger than they are, and will have a hard time
    backstabbing somebody if there is a lot of fighting going on
    around the target.

#
"SKILL CALL STEED"
    Usable by   :  pal 11
    Usage       :  call steed
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill can be used by a paladin to bring a faithful mount
    to his side, able to be ridden outdoors and save the paladin
    strength to fight.  You automatically 'mount' the horse that
    arrives, and it will obey your commands while you ride it.
    If you don't wish to ride it any more you can 'dismount' it
    and it will remain where it is for you to come back.  The horse
    will obey your orders while you ride it, and aid you in combat.

#
"SKILL CAMOUFLAGE"
    Usable by   :  barb 1
    Usage       :  camouflage
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is used by barbarians to hide in the outdoors, so that
    the only way someone can even know he or she is there is by having
    the spell 'sense life' active.  Being hidden means that you can not
    be targeted except by an opponent with both the 'sense life' and
    the 'true sight' spells.  Area effect spells can still cause you
    damage however.  Any activity will cancel out your hiding, and make
    you visible to all.

#
"SKILL CANIBALIZE"
    Usable by   :  psi 2
    Usage       :  canibalize <amount of hitpoints>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is a great boon to a psionist.  By specifying a number
    of hitpoints after the command, the psionist can change hitpoints
    into mana.  The number of mana points gained is twice as many
    hitpoints.  So if you "canibalize 10" you would receive 20 mana
    points.  You should be careful not to drain your life down so low
    that you are in danger from physical attacks.  If you fail to
    successfully canibalize the health, it is gone with no benefit.

#
"SKILL CARVE"
    Usable by   :  ranger 1
    Usage       :  carve <corpse obj>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  5 if fail

    This skill is known only to the ranger, and is the ability to
    create food out of the carcass of a corpse.  The corpse must
    be of a size able to support this activity, a butterfly is
    not going to make a good ration, but a dragon might provide
    days worth of meals.

#
"SKILL CAST"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  cast '<spell>' [<target>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting
    Speed       :  Determined by spell cast
    Mana        :  Determined by spell cast

    This skill is the basic skill that allows for magic spells to be
    cast.  It only provides access to magic, the spells themselves
    determine all aspects of what happens.  You are either able to
    cast spells or not, there is no "learning" of the cast skill.
    See the individual help of the spell in question to learn what
    it does and how it behaves.

#
"SKILL CHARGE"
    Usable by   :  pal 4,
    Usage       :  charge <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill allows a paladin and his or her mount to become a single
    deadly force, initiating combat with a devastating attack.  While
    riding a mount, the paladin, who must be wielding a weapon that does
    impale damage, rams into the target creature, inflicting terrible
    damage.

#
"SKILL CLIMB"
    Usable by   :  thief 1, ranger 1, barb 1,
    Usage       :  climb <north | east | south | west | up | down>
    Positions   :  standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is used as a substitute to flying in certain places.
    If the way out of a room is marked as a climbable exit, then
    this skill can be used to scale the way across.  Obviously if
    the exit you wish to go to is in midair, then there is no
    way to climb to it.  Be careful, a slip here and you could fall
    quite a ways and possibly be gravely injured.

#
"SKILL DISARM"
    Usable by   :  thief 1, ranger 1, pal 1, monk 1, barb 1, warrior 1
    Usage       :  disarm <trap obj | mob>
    Positions   :  standing, fighting
    Speed       :  For disarming traps: Fast
                   For disarming mobs: Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is used in two ways.  The first is only learned by
    thieves, and that is to disarm deadly traps.  The other is
    used by fighters to disarm an opponent.  Monks are more proficient
    at this maneuver than other fighters.  If successful the weapon
    of the opponent is sent flying from his or her hand and they are
    forced to fight bare handed unless they can retrieve the weapon or
    wield a new weapon.  Something to keep in mind is that many
    creatures do devastating damage with their bare fists and the
    weapon they wield makes little difference in the level of danger
    they represent.

#
"SKILL DISENGAGE"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  disengage [<-skill>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill can be learned to back out of combat without having to
    flee madly from the room.  Using the "-skill" argument will tell
    you how well you have learned this skill and using the command
    without any argument while fighting will cause you to stop
    fighting if successful.  If you are the tank for a fight and
    attempt this, chances are the opponent will start hitting you
    again as soon as he or she can.

#
"SKILL DISGUISE"
    Usable by   :  barb 1, thief 1
    Usage       :  disguise
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill gives you the ability to hide from any people who might
    hate you.  This skill, which can only be used once a day, will
    keep you safe from somebody you have been fighting with earlier.
    They will not recognize you and will not attack you, unless they
    would normally attack you by being 'aggressive'.

#
"SKILL DOORBASH"
    Usable by   :  warrior 1, ranger 1, barb 1
    Usage       :  doorbash <door name> [<north | east | south | west |
                   up | down>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill costs nothing in mana, but it does cost some movement
    points, which is logical given that this skill is nothing besides
    throwing ones shoulder against a door in an attempt to open it.
    Some doors can not be forced no matter what and will need a key.
    If you are clumsy in attempting this maneuver, you will end up
    stumbling through the door into the next room.  If you fail to
    open a door, you will find yourself stunned, with a ringing head
    and a bruised shoulder.

#
"SKILL DOORWAY"
    Usable by   :  psi 3
    Usage       :  doorway <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  20

    This skill is a defining ability of the psionist mental powers.
    Using this skill, a psionist can instantly transport him or herself
    to another creature.  The travel is cheap, fast, and comes at a very
    low level.  It is the first step to the powerful transportation magics
    available to a psionist.

#
"SKILL ESP"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  esp
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  10

    This skill helps a psionist to understand every type of language,
    simply bypassing the words and looking at the thoughts.  It doesn't
    do anything to help the psionist speak any language, but at least
    he or she can understand anybody while the skill lasts, which may
    be as long as a day at the highest level of ability.

#
"SKILL FEIGN DEATH"
    Usable by   :  monk 1
    Usage       :  feign death
    Positions   :  fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is only able to be achieved by monks without the aid of
    magic.  If successful, the monk will immediately pretend to be
    struck down fatally in combat.  The opponents being thus fooled
    will stop fighting, leaving the monk free to recover.  If the monk
    is very good at this skill, he or she might not even be noticed
    anymore, being hidden in plain sight as a corpse.

#
"SKILL FIND FOOD"
    Usable by   :  barb 1, ranger 1
    Usage       :  find food
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill enables you to scrounge up a handful of berries as
    sustenance in the outdoors.  It is a slow, tedious process and
    has no chance of working indoors.  It is rumored that there
    is a way for anybody to learn these skills.

#
"SKILL FIND TRAP"
    Usable by   :  thief 1
    Usage       :
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill, learnable by thieves, gives an almost supernatural
    ability to detect the presence of traps, which are invisible
    to the naked eye.  It requires no particular concentration
    on the part of the thief, the traps are visible to him or
    her just like any other object of a room.  The majority of
    traps are triggered by disturbing them by touching them or
    by attempting to move past them.

#
"SKILL FIND WATER"
    Usable by   :  barb 1, ranger 1
    Usage       :  find water
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill enables you to scrounge up a cupful of water as
    sustenance in the outdoors.  It is a slow, tedious process and
    has no chance of working indoors.  It is rumored that there
    is a way for anybody to learn these skills.

#
"SKILL FIRST AID"
    Usable by   :  ranger 1, barb 1,
    Usage       :  first aid
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill, usable once per day, provides a quick boost of
    healing to the ranger or barbarian.  The amount of healing
    is determined by the level of the character.

#
"SKILL FLAME SHROUD"
    Usable by   :  psi 15
    Usage       :  flame
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  40

    This skill gives the psionist the power to summon flames, like
    the 'fireshield' spell around his body.  This skill lasts much
    longer than the 'fireshield' spell, and as long as it lasts, if
    anybody hits the psionist, the shroud will scorch them with fire.

#
"SKILL FLOWERFIST"
    Usable by   :  monk 36
    Usage       :  flowerfist
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is not that impressive in terms of damage, but the
    very fact that an unarmed fighter is able to cause damage to
    multiple opponents at once is impressive enough.  It deals
    between 6 and 36 points of damage to as many as 7 opponents.
    This damage comes from focussing the chi to allow a brief moment
    where the monk's punching fist is actually in several places at
    once.

#
"SKILL FLURRY"
    Usable by   :  monk 18
    Usage       :  flurry
    Positions   :  fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is a powerful combat maneuver, that only masters
    of the martial arts can even attempt.  By focussing the chi,
    the monk can make combat seem to move more slowly, giving
    him more attacks and a better chance of hitting his opponents.
    It only lasts for one round of combat, and after that you
    have to recover for a bit before trying again.

#
"SKILL GREAT SIGHT"
    Usable by   :  psi 11
    Usage       :  great
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  50

    This skill grants the psionist a great deal of detection abilities
    in one skill.  Using this will grant the psionist the same effects
    as the spells 'true sight', 'sense life' and 'detect invisibility'.
    The amount of time all the effects last is different for each effect,
    but the more powerful the psionist, the longer the effect lasts.

#
"SKILL HEROIC RESCUE"
    Usable by   :  pal 1
    Usage       :  heroic
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is a great boon to a paladin, especially one traveling
    with weaker companions.  Acting much like the 'rescue' skill, it
    allows the paladin to step in between his or her companion and
    the dangerous opponents they were fighting.  It is considered
    significantly superior to the 'rescue' skill in the fact that
    no target has to be specified.  This is because the 'heroic
    rescue' skill will automatically rescue all members of your group
    from combat.  If you have 3 group members fighting 2 different
    opponents, doing a 'heroic rescue' will mean that the 2 group
    members who were being attacked by the opponents will be rescued
    from the combat and you will now be getting attacked by both of the
    opponents they were fighting.  Essentially, the paladin will be
    throwing himself in between his or her companions and any opponent
    of the group.

"SKILL HIDE"
    Usable by   :  thief 1, ranger 2, monk 1
    Usage       :  hide
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill can be very useful to the thief, monk, and ranger
    in certain circumstances.  The ranger can only use this ability
    outside, but the monk and thief can use it anywhere.  If you
    successfully hide, you will be almost completely undetectable.
    Without the 'sense life' spell or ability, any other creature
    will have no idea that you are even present in the room.  Without
    'sense life' and 'true sight' you can not even be targeted by
    another creature.  However, the moment you take any action, you
    will no longer be considered hiding and can be spotted by anybody
    who would normally be able to see you.

#
"SKILL HUNT"
    Usable by   :  barb 1, ranger 1, thief 1
    Usage       :  track <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is very useful, and can be mimicked by the spells 'minor
    track' and 'major track'.  It allows the barbarian or ranger to
    track down a particular creature.  While not all creatures can
    be tracked, the more skilled you are at hunting, the farther
    away the target can be and still be tracked.  You are slowed down
    while you track your quarry.

#
"SKILL HYPNOTIZE"
    Usable by   :  psi 2
    Usage       :  hypnotize <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  25

    This skill is used by a psionist to overwhelm the mind of another
    creature and force it do his or her bidding.  If a creature is
    extraordinarily stupid, it is impossible to create a mental
    connection to it.  If successful, the creature will obey your
    every 'order' for the next day and a half.

#
"SKILL ID"
    Usable by   :  mage 10, sorc 10, cleric 16
    Usage       :  id <obj>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  15

    This skill is actually just a short cut to casting the 'identify'
    spell.  Thus, you must be able to cast the 'identify' spell for
    this "skill" to work.

#
"SKILL KICK"
    Usable by   :  warrior 1, monk 1
    Usage       :  kick [<mob>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is a combat maneuver, if used while fighting without
    specifying a target, your current opponent will be the target.
    Monks are much better than a warrior at this action, but it
    takes both of them a long time to recover.

#
"SKILL LAY ON HANDS"
    Usable by   :  pal 1
    Usage       :  lay on hands <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is a powerful one shot healing ability of the paladin.
    Once per day, the paladin can lay hands on another person, healing
    them of damage.  The more powerful the paladin, the greater the
    healing, and if the target is pure enough to be a paladin themselves,
    the healing is doubled.

#
"SKILL LEGSWEEP"
    Usable by   :  monk 1
    Usage       :  legsweep [<mob>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is the monk's equivalent of the 'bash' skill for
    fighters.  If successful the monk will knock the target down
    to the ground, temporarily stunning them.  The monk also needs
    time to recover from the attack.  If all goes well the monk
    will be ready to legsweep the opponent again when the opponent
    finally starts to stand up.  If no target is specified then
    the current opponent will be targeted.

"SKILL MEDITATE"
    Usable by   :  psi 1
    Usage       :  meditate
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is available to psionists to place themselves into
    a rejuvenating trance.  While meditating, which is a position
    similar to resting, the psionist will recover mana faster than
    if he or she were just resting.  Probably not as fast as sleeping
    but the psionist is still aware of all that happens around him
    or her while meditating.

#
"SKILL MEMORIZE"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  memorize '<spell>'
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Depends on Spell
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is used by sorcerers to memorize spells so that later
    they can 'recall' them.  Instead of using mana to power any
    spell, the sorcerer commits a particular spell to memory, then
    instead of using 'cast' to launch a spell, the sorcerer uses
    'recall' to launch the spell.  However, once the sorcerer has
    successfully memorized a spell, he or she can recall it perfectly,
    there is no chance of the spell failing.  Low power spells, memorized
    by a very intelligent high level sorcerer takes practically no time
    at all.  However, a very powerful spell that is just at the edge of
    your ability to cast will take much longer.

#
"SKILL MEND"
    Usable by   :  warrior 1
    Usage       :  mend <obj>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill, which is available only to warriors, allows a warrior
    to fix damaged gear.  Failure means that the equipment is actually
    worse off than it was before the attempted mending, but success
    brings the gear back to full strength, even weapons.

#
"SKILL MESSENGER"
    Usable by   :  cleric 1, druid 1
    Usage       :  messenger <mob> <message>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  5

    This skill allows a cleric or druid to send a private message to
    anybody in the realm.  Nobody but the user and the target know
    what is said, or even that anything was said.  This is similar
    to a global 'tell' command.

#
"SKILL MIND"
    Usable by   :  psi 1
    Usage       :  mind '<power>'
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting
    Speed       :  Depends on skill called
    Mana        :  Depends on skill called

    This skill is the psionist equivalent to the 'cast' command.
    The psionist accesses his powers throw this command, see the
    different powers (which are found under "help mind <power>")
    to find the specific details.

#
"SKILL PICK"
    Usable by   :  thief 1
    Usage       :  pick <door name>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill allows a thief to unlock a door without a key.
    Not all doors can be unlocked in this manner, some require
    a key no matter what you attempt to do to the door.

#
"SKILL PSI PORTAL"
    Usable by   :  psi 32
    Usage       :  portal <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  50

    This skill is one of the psionists more expensive powers, but
    very useful in a group.  When successfully used, this power
    opens a brief portal to the target, and every companion of
    the psionist steps through it, appearing instantly at the
    target's location.

#
"SKILL PSIONIC INVISIBILITY"
    Usable by   :  psi 1
    Usage       :  psionic invisibility
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  10

    This skill allows the psionist to briefly contact the minds of
    the creatures he or she encounters.  In that brief moment, the
    psionist convinces the creature that he or she is not there.
    When a creature looks to where the psionist is, their brain
    refuses to acknowledge what is in front of them.  However, due
    to the magical way that the 'detect invisibility' spell works,
    it will show the truth of even an invisible psionist.  Any
    attack will dispel the invisibility automatically, and it can
    be cancelled manually by using the 'vis' command.  The longest
    this power can be maintained is a day.

#
"SKILL QUIVERING PALM"
    Usable by   :  monk 30
    Usage       :  quivering palm [<mob>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is the most terrifying ability of the monk.  By
    concentrating chi into the hand, and a near perfect knowledge
    of physical and spiritual anatomy, the monk can set up
    deadly vibrations in the body and soul of an opponent.  If
    successful, the opponent will likely drop dead, due to an
    interruption in the flow of blood and chi.  If an opponent
    is more powerful than you, or has a great deal more hitpoints,
    then this skill will be ineffectual against them.  This
    devastating ability is so draining that it can only be
    performed once a week.

#
"SKILL RECALL"
    Usable by   :  sorc 1
    Usage       :  recall '<spell>' [<target>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting
    Speed       :  Depends on spell
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is only used by the sorcerer, and it replaces
    the 'cast' command for launching spells.  If the sorcerer
    has a spell memorized, this command will release it and
    the effects are determined by which spell it is.  This
    command can never fail, if the spell has been memorized,
    recalling it is flawless.

#
"SKILL RECALLHOME"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  recallhome
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is most useful for low level characters.  Provided
    that you are on the same plane as your home town (the inn where
    you last rented), this command will return you to that place.
    However, it is not a sure thing, your chances of successfully
    recalling decrease as your level increases.  Your percentage
    of successfully doing it ranges from 100% as a brand new
    character to 2% as a powerful hero.  If you do use the command
    successfully, you will be instantly returned, but your movement
    will have been drained to 0.

#
"SKILL RECITE"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  recite <scroll> [<target>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is used to cast the magic from a scroll.  The scroll
    will burst into flames, so it is not reusable, and the target
    of the scroll will be the target of whatever spells are released.

#
"SKILL RESCUE"
    Usable by   :  warrior 1, ranger 3
    Usage       :  rescue <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is used to rescue one person who is currently getting
    beat up by an opponent.  If successful, the target is removed
    from combat with that opponent, but other opponents can still
    continue to attack the target.  The target will be temporarily
    stunned by the rescue and won't be able to initiate new actions
    until he or she recovers.

#
"SKILL RETREAT"
    Usable by   :  thief 1, monk 1, barb 1
    Usage       :  retreat
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is not a separate ability, but is built in to
    the 'flee' command.  You can use the 'retreat' command, but
    it merely calls the 'flee' command.  If you succeed in your
    retreat skill, you will not flee blindly and not lose
    experience for running away.  It merely turns what was
    a panicky maneuver into one that has some order to it.

#
"SKILL RIDE"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  ride <rideable mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill doubles as both a learnable skill "riding" that
    helps you to control your animal when mounted, and it also
    will perform the 'mount' command.  If you have learned the
    riding skill well, you will fall off your mount far less
    often than if you have not learned anything about it, which
    can be a big difference if you plan on fighting from the
    back of your mount.

#
"SKILL SCRIBE"
    Usable by   :  cleric 1
    Usage       :  scribe '<spell>'
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  Depends on spell

    This skill is used by clerics to make a scroll that has a
    spell imbued on it.  The spell is decided by the cleric,
    and it costs twice as much mana to put it on a scroll as
    it does to cast it normally.  The scroll has a limited
    shelf life, it's not stable and will dissolve in a matter
    of hours.  The scroll can be recited just like any other
    scroll.  Not all spells are able to be scribed onto a
    scroll, check the individual spell help to see if that
    spell can be scribed.

#
"SKILL SCRY"
    Usable by   :  psi 7
    Usage       :  scry <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  20

    This skill is used by a psionist to view the location of a
    target creature.  Any target in the world can be viewed,
    provided they aren't protected somehow.

#
"SKILL SENDING"
    Usable by   :  ranger 1, mage 1, sorc 1
    Usage       :  sending <mob> <message>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  5

    This skill allows a mage, sorcerer or ranger to send a private
    message to anybody in the realm.  Nobody but the user and the
    target know what is said, or even that anything was said.  This
    is similar to a global 'tell' command.

#
"SKILL PSI SHIELD"
    Usable by   :  psi 1
    Usage       :  shield
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  10

    This skill is a simple piece of unconscious telekinesis that provides
    a barrier between the psionist and harm.  It can only push away
    physical threats, so it protects against the psionist in combat.  The
    barrier grows stronger as the psionist gets stronger, eventually
    protecting better than any armor ever crafted.

#
"SKILL SNEAK"
    Usable by   :  thief 1, ranger 4, monk 1
    Usage       :  sneak
    Positions   :  standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill allows the character to walk around without being noticed
    by anybody.  It will slow down your travelling, since you must take
    more care with your steps, but if successful,  you will be able
    to sneak past almost any creature.  However, in order to sneak about,
    you can not be wearing any item that makes noise, such as a powerful
    magic item that hums.  Rangers can not sneak indoors, only outdoors,
    so this skill has limited use for them in urban settings.

#
"SKILL SPOT"
    Usable by   :  ranger 3, pal 1, warrior 1, barb 1
    Usage       :  spot [<north | east | south | west | up | down>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Spotting in a direction: Medium
                   Spotting all around: Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill allows you to look around and scan for other creatures
    nearby.  Only the paladin and the ranger can learn this skill from
    their guildmasters.  But there is another teacher of this skill that
    any fighter can learn from.  You can not spot any creatures that you
    normally wouldn't be able to see anyway, such as hidden creatures,
    or invisible creatures.  Spotting in a direction will narrow your
    focus, which can be useful in crowded areas.

#
"SKILL SPRING LEAP"
    Usable by   :  monk 1
    Usage       :  springleap [<mob>]
    Positions   :  sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill can be a significant advantage in combat for a monk.
    If the monk is somehow knocked from his feet during combat, he
    can leap off the ground in a tremendous move, driving both feet
    into his or her opponent.  The effect of this is to stun the
    opponent for a short time while doing some damage to the opponent
    and to regain your feet, so that you are standing and ready to
    continue the fight.

#
"SKILL SPY"
    Usable by   :  thief 1, ranger 1, barb 1
    Usage       :  spy
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill allows a person to peer into the next room over by
    using the 'look' command with a direction argument.  If this
    skill is successful, you will see into the next room exactly
    as though you were there.  Very useful for looking before
    leaping.

#
"SKILL STEAL"
    Usable by   :  thief 1
    Usage       :  steal <coins | obj> <mob>
    Positions   :  standing
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill allows a thief to steal gold from another creature,
    provided that creature has some gold.  Also if the target
    has some items in his or her inventory, then they can be
    stolen as well.  Of course the possibility exists that you
    might fail and get caught, but that is the risk that all
    thieves will take.

#
"SKILL PSI SUMMON"
    Usable by   :  psi 15
    Usage       :  summon <mob>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  30

    This skill is very useful to the psionist.  By focussing on the target,
    the psionist can create a portal wherever the target is, and move the
    portal around the creature.  This is the opposite of how the psionist
    uses the 'doorway' skill.  Instead of making a portal from him or
    herself to the target, the psionist makes a portal at the target and
    brings the target to him or her.  The target is not prepared for this
    and will likely be disoriented by the trip.  You can not summon
    creatures who are more powerful than you, and this portal can only
    work on the same plane of existence.  Sometimes the target will be
    protected from this type of ability through magic.  This skill is
    different from the 'summon' spell that mages, sorcerers, and clerics
    receive.  Sometimes the spell will be blocked, while this ability
    can reach the target.

#
"SKILL SWIM"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  swim
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  0

    This skill can be used to temporarily allow yourself to swim underwater.
    For a short duration, you will be able to be underwater, but when you
    can't hold your breath any longer, you better be in an air filled room.

#
"SKILL TAN"
    Usable by   :  ranger 1
    Usage       :  tan <corpse obj> <shield | jacket | boots | gloves |
                   leggings | sleeves | helmet | bag>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing
    Speed       :  Medium
    Mana        :  0

    This skill allows a ranger to skin a corpse for the hide, in order
    to make one of several items out of it.  The more powerful the
    creature, the more effective the armor.

#
"SKILL TELEPATHY"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  telepathy <mob> <message>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Fast
    Mana        :  5

    This skill allows a psionist to send a private and discreet
    message to anybody in the realm.  Nobody but the user and the
    target know what is said, or even that anything was said.  This
    is similar to a global 'tell' command.

#
"SKILL VALUE ITEM"
    Usable by   :  thief 1
    Usage       :  value [<mob>] <obj>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is the ability of the thief to appraise an item.  A
    thief gets so good at this skill, he can glean much pertinent
    information from a single glance.  A skilled thief can even
    glean information about an object that somebody else has.

#
"SKILL WARCRY"
    Usable by   :  pal 5
    Usage       :  warcry [<mob>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting
    Speed       :  Slow
    Mana        :  0

    This skill is a tremendous combat ability of the paladin.  By
    shouting out the battle cry of his or her god, the paladin can
    actually cause an enemy to feel as though they were physically
    struck.  The more powerful the paladin is in relation to the
    target determines how effective the warcry is.  There is even
    a possibility that the warcry will paralyze an opponent if the
    paladin is much more powerful.

    This spell can make a weak willed animal follow you and accept your
    commands.  The animal must be less powerful than you, and must be
    of neutral alignment.  Evil and good aligned animals are too strong
    willed to be charmed.  This spell can only be successfully cast once
    per day.  Some similar spells are 'charm person', 'charm monster', and

"SPELL ANIMAL GROWTH"
    Castable by :  druid 35, ranger 35

    but only in naturally occurring animals.  A polymorphed creature
    can not be targeted by this spell.  The creature has to be
    significantly weaker than the caster, stronger creatures shrug
    off the effects of the magic, which grants greater stamina and
    strength.  The animal will obey any 'order' of the caster.

"SPELL ANIMATE DEAD"

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell will take a corpse from a newly deceased creature
    and animate it into a undead servant of the caster.  Even a
    pile of dust from a previously slain undead is enough to
    create a zombie, whose own power is dependent on the level
    of the caster.  The zombie will obey any 'order' of the caster.


#
"SPELL ANIMATE ROCK"
    Castable by :  druid 31
    Usage       :  cast 'animate rock' <rock obj>

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    If a druid stumbles upon a rock during his or her travels,
    they can use this spell to make the rock animate and follow
    the caster.  Bigger rocks make better servants, so boulders
    are preferable to fist-sized stones.  The rock will obey
    any 'order' of the caster.


#
"SPELL ANTI MAGIC SHELL"
    Castable by :  mage 48, sorcerer 48
    Usage       :  cast 'anti magic shell'

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This powerful spell has an extremely short duration, lasting
    only one hour.  But during that time, no magic may pass into
    or out of the shell.  The mage is perfectly protected from
    all magics, even beneficial spells.  It dispels all current
    spells of the caster, and allows no further casting to take
    place by the caster.  However, spell-like abilities of
    magical weapons and items can be used within a shell to
    great effect.  Only true mages can cast this spell, if a
    player has not devoted him or herself to the casting arts
    they can not possibly learn the intricacies of this spell.


#
"SPELL ARMOR"
    Castable by :  mage 5, cleric 2, sorcerer 5

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This basic spell gives a decent bonus to the Armor Class of
    the target.  Essentially, it reinforces whatever armor is
    worn with rigid magical energy.  The effect lasts approximately
    one full day.


#
"SPELL ASTRAL WALK"
    Castable by :  cleric 30
    Usage       :  cast 'astral walk' <mob>
    Targets     :  Mob in World

    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  30
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This powerful clerical magic allows the caster to send any
    creature to the astral plane.  Anybody who is grouped with
    the target is also shifted to the astral plane.  In the
    astral plane, travel throughout the world is possible by
    entering the color pools, but blindly jumping into pools is
    not recommended for the wise adventurer.  Only grouped
    individuals can be sent, if you cast this spell and the
    target does not get shifted to the other plane, check to
    make sure the target is grouped, even if only with him or
    herself.


#
"SPELL AURA OF POWER"

    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A boon granted to paladins, this spell grants the caster
    great martial prowess for almost half of a day.  A faithful
    paladin will hit more often and with more power when this
    spell is active.


#
"SPELL BARKSKIN"
    Castable by :  druid 3
    Usage       :  cast 'barkskin' <mob>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  5
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell will make the target's skin turn brown and rough, like
    thick bark from an old tree.  It will make it harder for opponents
    to hit the target, and confer some benefit in avoiding full damage
    from spells.


#
"SPELL BIND AFFINITY"
    Castable by :  necromancer 48
    Usage       :  cast 'bind affinity'
    Targets     :  None
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  50
    Casting Time:  Slow
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This unique spell creates a special relationship between the caster
    and where the caster is currently standing.  By casting this spell,
    the place where the spell 'binding' transports you to will change.
    Normally the 'binding' spell returns you to the inn where you last
    rented.  After casting this spell, 'binding' will return you to the
    room where you cast this spell last.  So if you cast this spell
    in The Meeting Square of Karsinya, then casting 'binding' will
    transport you to The Meeting Square.  However, if you are not on
    the same plane as your binding spot, the spell 'binding' won't
    be able to transport you to it.


#
"SPELL BINDING"
    Castable by :  necromancer 16
    Usage       :  cast 'binding'
    Targets     :  None
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  15
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell functions much like the spell 'word of recall' for
    clerics.  It will transport you instantly from wherever you are
    to your binding spot.  Normally, your binding spot is the inn
    where you last rented.  However through the use of 'bind affinity'
    you can change that spot to wherever you desire.  'Binding' will
    only work if you are on the same plane as your current binding spot.


#
"SPELL BLADE BARRIER"
    Castable by :  cleric 45
    Usage       :  cast 'blade barrier'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  8-64
    Damage Type :  Slash
    Saving Throw:  vs. Spell for 1/2 Damage
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  40
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is one of the most devastating defensive spells ever
    crafted.  Any cleric casting this spell is instantly surrounded
    by a glittering shield of whirling blades.  These blades flash
    through the air, cutting any opponent who dares to attack the
    caster.  The only way for an opponent to hit you safely is if
    they also have a 'blade barrier' spell in place, in which case
    the two spells spark and clash, but do no damage to the people
    involved.  It is impossible to have both 'blade barrier' and
    any other defensive shield spell in place, such as 'fireshield'
    or 'chillshield'.

#
"SPELL BLESS"
    Castable by :  cleric 1, sorcerer 17

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This minor spell grants a small boon to the target, making him or
    her hit more often in combat, and have a better chance of avoiding
    the full impact of spells.


#
"SPELL BLINDNESS"
    Castable by :  mage 12, cleric 14, sorcerer 12
    Usage       :  cast 'blindness' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Fairly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell will instantly blind the target, making the target
    much easier to hit in combat, and making it much harder for
    the target to hit anybody else.


#
"SPELL BURNING HANDS"
    Castable by :  mage 6, sorcerer 6
    Usage       :  cast 'burning hands'
    Targets     :  All Mobs in Room
    Damage      :  2-5 + (Level / 2)
    Damage Type :  Fire
    Saving Throw:  vs. Spell to Negate
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  15
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    The most basic magic capable of doing damage to multiple opponents,
    this spell will shoot forth a sheet of flames from the caster's
    hands.  However, if an opponent is quick enough, they will be able
    to avoid the flames altogether, leaving them unharmed.  If this
    spell is cast in a dark room, any creature using infravision to
    see will have a chance of being temporarily blinded by the heat.
    If any of the victims has wings, they have a chance of being burnt
    off by the fire.


#
"SPELL CACAODEMON"
    Castable by :  mage 30, cleric 29, sorcerer 30
    Usage       :  cast 'cacaodemon' <one | two | three | four | five | six>
    Targets     :  None

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A powerful and dangerous summoning spell, this allows the caster to
    tap into the outer planes and summon demons to do his or her bidding.
    There are six demons capable of being summoned by this spell, the
    least powerful summoned by the first spell, and the most powerful
    by the sixth.  A sacrificial offering must be held or wielded by the
    caster, which will likely be destroyed by the summoning.  Summoning
    a demon will tend to lead even the most goodly intentioned people
    down the road towards evil, so be careful when casting this spell,
    it leaves a black stain on your soul.

    Some of the sacrificial items that are known to be of use with this
    spell are:
    a potion brewed by a hag, held by a ghost in the land of Ixzuul
    a whip, a dagger, and a longsword, held in a city protected by a dracolich
    a named dagger, which can be found in the possession of a halfling
    a runed dagger, held by a small man dressed all in yellow in a ruined city


#
"SPELL CALL LIGHTNING"
    Castable by :  cleric 45, druid 18
    Usage       :  cast 'call lightning' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent

    Casting Time:  Slow
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This powerful spell can destroy opponents harnessing the power of
    nature itself.  Only able to be cast outside, and the weather must
    be at least raining, if not actually storming, it calls bolts of
    lightning down from the heavens to roast the target.  The weather
    can be affected by the spell 'control weather', so that a powerful
    cleric or druid can change a sunny day into a stormy one, and then
    turn the might of the storm on their hapless opponents.


#
"SPELL CALM"
    Castable by :  mage 4, cleric 2, sorcerer 4, paladin 18

    This spell allows a cleric to cause damage to the target.  There is
    no particular type of damage associated with this spell, it does not

    is possible to waste the spell if the target dodges the cleric's touch.
    It is considered the reverse of the 'cure critical' spell, and has

    Only castable twice per day, this spell allows a druid to
    take the form of a desired animal.  The level of the druid
    determines what type of animals are available to change into.
    Once the druid is ready to return to his or her original form,

    animals are appropriate for the same creature type, (i.e. "bear")
    the spell will default to changing to the more powerful version.

    holds magical charges into a powerful mobile tree
    servant.  The druid must be holding the magical staff in
    his hand when the spell is cast.  The tree's loyalty to

    that remained in the staff.  The staff is destroyed in the
    casting of this spell, but the greater the staff's power,
    the longer the tree will remain loyal.  The tree will obey
    every 'order' of the caster.

    This spell infuses the target with a bone deep chill, causing
    great harm.  The damage done by this is strictly dependent on
    the level of the caster.  A 20th level caster will do between
    20 and 60 damage.  If the target manages to dodge the worst
    of the effects of the spell, they will take only half the
    damage from the deadly chill.  If they fail to avoid the spell,
    it will also weaken the target until they warm up.  Being the
    target of multiple castings of this spell will result in dangerous
    levels of weakness.

    This is a defensive spell, which creates an aura of intense cold
    around you, in the form of blue flames.  Any creature attacking
    you will take some damage from the shield.  However, if you
    attempt to create a 'chillshield' while surrounded by another
    defensive shield, like 'fireshield' or 'blade barrier' the
    'chillshield' will supplant the old defensive spell.  Having this
    spell around you allows you to safely attack an opponent who also
    is guarded by a 'chillshield'.

    This spell enables the summoning of a powerful elemental to
    follow and aid the caster.  There is a material component
    to this spell, which determines what type of elemental is
    summoned by this spell.  The material components are some
    magical stones that are usually found in the possession of
    lamias.  As might be expected, the stones are somewhat
    logical components for the different elemental types.
    A fiery red stone, a dull stone, a pale blue stone, and a
    clear stone are commonly known stones that work for
    this spell.  Any elemental summoned by this spell will remain

    By using this spell, the caster can alter the very powerful
    forces of nature.  Making vast alterations in the weather
    patterns of the world is possible.  By indicating whether
    the caster wishes the weather to become 'better' or 'worse',
    the caster can shift the weather one step at a time.  Through
    multiple castings of this spell, the cleric or druid could
    make a cloudless day into a stormy one, or a blizzard into a
    sunny day.  This spell is often used to worsen the weather to

    This extremely powerful, special magic can result in devastating
    damage and great danger to all.  Casting this spell creates an
    almost completely uncontrolled swarm of devouring insects.
    Whatever gets in their way is killed until the swarm has
    dissipated or is destroyed.  Casting this spell is so draining
    that the druid collapses immediately after for a short period
    of time.  His or her last conscious thought pushes the swarm
    in a desired direction.  Once there, the swarm will kill
    indiscriminately, and even has a chance to wander around into
    other areas once it has devoured all in that room. It might even
    wander back into the room with the caster, which could be deadly
    for it's own creator.

"SPELL CURSE"
    Castable by :  mage 13, cleric 12, sorcerer 13
    Usage       :  cast 'curse' <mob | obj>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   Obj in Room

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell functions quite the opposite of the spell 'bless'.
    Casting it on a target means that the target will suffer from
    a decreased chance of hitting opponents in battle, and is more
    susceptible to spells involving paralyzation.  The effect lasts
    a long time, in the range of a full week.  However, far more
    insidious is casting this spell on an object.  A cursed object
    becomes unable to be wielded by good aligned creatures, and
    no creature can get rid of it without casting 'remove curse'
    on the item.  If it is a weapon, it also makes the weapon
    less likely to hit in combat.

#
"SPELL DARK EMPATHY"
    Castable by :  necromancer 24
    Usage       :  cast 'dark empathy' <mob>

    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Oddly enough, the necromancer has the capability to heal others
    by transferring his or her own health to the target.  However,
    the life force transfer can not take place between a necromancer
    and a good aligned target, the energies are too different.
    Also, if the necromancer is badly hurt, he or she can not cast
    this spell successfully.  There is an upper limit to the amount
    of damage this will heal similar in power to the 'heal' spell.


#
"SPELL DARK PACT"
    Castable by :  necromancer 36
    Usage       :  cast 'dark pact'
    Targets     :  Self Only

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    For a handful of hours, this spell creates a contract with the
    dark powers of the world.  Essentially trading life force for
    magical power, this spell reduces your ability to regain your
    health in exchange for a larger mana regeneration amount.  The
    magical power spent on this spell is almost completely offset
    within the first hour of the pact.


#
"SPELL DARKTRAVEL"
    Castable by :  necromancer 39
    Usage       :  cast 'darktravel' <mob>

    Casting Time:  Medium

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Using this spell, the necromancer is able to walk through the
    darkness of the shadow realms to appear in the presence of the
    target.  However, this spell has some limitations.  If the target
    is not on the normal plane, the shadow realm has no access to them.
    Obviously this means that if you are on a different plane than your
    home plane, you also have no access to the shadow realm.  Also there
    are some magical counters to this spell, which prevents magical
    transport of any kind to the target.  A final warning, if your
    concentration falters while you travel the shadow realm, there is no
    telling where you might end up.


#
"SPELL DECAY"
    Castable by :  necromancer 18

    Casting Time:  Medium

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell has a quick short term effect, and then a more
    lasting debilitating effect.  By casting this spell, the
    necromancer uses his touch to begin a necrotic illness
    in the target.  Immediately the target's internal organs
    spasm, causing damage, but more insidiously, for almost
    a handful of hours, the decay continues, eating away at
    the body of the target.  Forget about healing or regaining
    mana while under the effect of this spell, and also most
    races take massive damage every hour from this spell, as
    the spell literally liquifies the insides of the target.
    Halflings are somewhat resistant to this spell, taking
    less damage than other races.

    This spell will help the target to identify who is currently
    on the path of selfishness and darkness.  The taint of evil
    will show itself as a red aura surrounding any evil creature.
    It also will give a red glow to an object if the item is
    not usable by a good creature.  The spell can last a very long
    time if cast by a high level caster.

    time if cast by a high level caster.

    A staple of most magic users, this spell will allow the
    target to see people and items that have been rendered invisible
    by magic.  It does not do anything to help reveal creatures who
    are hidden from normal view.  The spell can last a very long time,
    depending on the level of the caster.

    burns in their blood.  If the target is an food object, it will
    tell you whether the food is poisoned.  The spell also works on
    drink containers, so if you have stumbled across a suspicious
    cup of liquid, this spell may save you from the wracking pains
    of being poisoned.

    This spell allows the necromancer to touch the target and
    instantly make them magically suffer the final stages of
    the plague.  Instantly, the target takes damage as his or
    her body is wracked by chills and sores appear.  Then
    over the course of the next half day, the disease ravages
    the body, eventually running it's course.  Halflings are
    naturally resistant to the spell, taking less damage than
    other races.

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Fairly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    One of the most devastating spells ever created, this magic
    has been the death and salvation of many adventurers.  The
    spell basically attempts to scatter the target into many
    tiny little pieces.  If an opponent is tough enough, they
    might last through the effect, otherwise they cease to exist.
    This spell is incredibly destructive to equipment, if you
    are hit by a couple of these spells and still survive, you
    will likely have little equipment left in one piece.  Most
    equipment doesn't even become ruined scraps, but rather
    disappears in a puff of smoke.

    plane.  This spell works against evil creatures, and is
    generally used by good aligned clerics.  Evil clerics can
    cast it, but it is at their own peril.

    A basic spell and one of the most important spells a magic user can
    learn.  This spell removes magical effects from the target.  If
    the target is affected by the 'sanctuary' spell, casting 'dispel
    magic' can remove it from them.  Think of this spell as a contest
    between the caster and the magic user who cast the spells the
    'dispel magic' wants to dispel.  'Dispel magic' will attempt to
    remove each magical effect on the target.  If the caster is the
    equal or more powerful than the magic, then the magic is dispelled.
    If the caster is less powerful than the magic, then the creature that
    has the magical effect can resist the attempt to remove it.  So a less
    powerful caster could potentially dispel only some of the magical
    effects of a target.  Only very powerful magic users can dispel the
    magical effects of items, but once that has been done, it allows
    the spell 'enchant weapon' or 'enchant armor' to be cast.

    own will.

    This unusual spell is one of the few purely offensive
    weapons in the cleric's arsenal.  Flying creatures are
    immune to the damage caused by this spell, but weak
    creatures are likely to be swallowed up by the very
    ground.  Any allies of the caster are safe from harm,
    but the effects of this spell can be felt from very

    This spell allows the caster to grant magical enhancements to
    non-magical armor.  There are some restrictions to this,
    especially if the armor has some similar magical effects to the
    ones granted by this spell.  Once the spell has been cast,
    the armor will receive some improvement to it's protective
    qualities.  The amount of the improvement is based on the power
    of the caster.  After the spell has been cast, the armor will
    be magical, and it's aura will be identical to the aura of the
    caster.

"SPELL ENCHANT WEAPON"
    Castable by :  mage 14, sorcerer 14, necromancer 21
    Usage       :  cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon obj>
    Targets     :  Obj in Inventory
                   Obj Equipped
    Damage      :  -

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell allows the caster to give magical enhancements to
    non-magical weapons.  As long as the weapon does not already
    have similar magic-like effects to those granted by this spell,
    it can be made to hit more often and harder in combat.  Higher
    level casters grant more powerful bonuses.  The weapon will
    be magical if this spell is successful, and it's aura will
    match the aura of the caster.

"SPELL ENDURE COLD"
    Castable by :  necromancer 12
    Usage       :  cast 'endure cold'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -

    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    By casting this spell, the necromancer brings some of the chill
    of the shadow realm into his or her body.  By doing so, the
    body can withstand great extremes of exterior coldness.  This
    resistance to cold will mean that any cold-based attack will do
    only 1/2 the damage as it would normally.  The amount of time
    the caster can hold the unnatural chill is dependent on the level
    of the caster, from only a pair of hours to almost half of a day.


#
"SPELL ENERGY DRAIN"
    Castable by :  mage 22, sorcerer 22, necromancer 15
    Usage       :  cast 'energy drain' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -

    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  35
    Casting Time:  Slow
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Fairly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This evil magical act will cause the target's life force to be
    permanently diminished.  Casting this spell is considered an
    evil act, and will tend to make the caster evil.  If the victim
    does not save, the caster will strip them of a level, and all
    the abilities and stats that go along with that level.  If a
    15th level cleric is struck by this spell, he or she will now
    be 14th level and will lose access to spells, such as 'earthquake'.
    Every vital statistic will drop accordingly.  The only way to get
    back the lost life force is to have a cleric cast 'energy restore'
    on you soon.  This spell has a chance of backfiring on the caster,
    so be careful using it.

#
"SPELL ENERGY RESTORE"
    Castable by :  cleric 48

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Somewhat Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    An incredibly useful spell, this is the cleric's response to the
    life draining abilities of undead and evil mages.  If the target
    has been recently drained, this spell will return that life force
    in full to them.  However, in doing so, the caster will end up
    exhausted and unable to move for a significant period of time.


#
"SPELL ENLIGHTENMENT"

    Casting Time:  Fast

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell grants the paladin a temporary boost to his or her
    intelligence and wisdom.  Many small things benefit from this,
    among them, practicing new spells becomes easier, and mana is
    recovered more swiftly.


#
"SPELL ENTANGLE"
    Castable by :  druid 16
    Usage       :  cast 'entangle' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is very powerful, but also very limited in scope.
    It can only be cast outdoors in a forest, but if it is
    successfully cast, the hands of nature will reach out and
    grasp the victim.  All the plants nearby will wrap the victim
    up so tightly that they can not move a muscle, and in fact
    are considered paralyzed for a short period of time.


#
"SPELL EYE OF THE DEAD"
    Castable by :  necromancer 26
    Usage       :  cast 'eye of the dead'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell grants the necromancer the ability to see everything
    around him or her.  Essentially, the spirits of the dead take
    up residence in one of the eyes of the caster.  Since the dead
    spirits have perceptions far different from our own, this spell
    gives the necromancer the equivalent of the cleric spell 'true
    sight'.  It lasts almost for a full day, before the spirits
    clamber for their release.


#
"SPELL FAERIE FIRE"
    Castable by :  mage 5, cleric 4, druid 1, sorcerer 5, ranger 7
    Usage       :  cast 'faerie fire' <mob>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   Not Self
    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is seemingly innocuous, it merely outlines the target
    in a pink light.  However, that pink light serves to make the
    target significantly easier to hit in combat.  Since most
    victims don't realize the significance of this spell, they don't
    treat it as a hostile intention.


#
"SPELL FAERIE FOG"
    Castable by :  mage 16, cleric 11, druid 10, sorcerer 16
    Usage       :  cast 'faerie fog'

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell creates a billowing cloud of purple smoke, which
    fills the area quickly and completely.  The cloud is not
    completely opaque and it has the tendency to clearly outline
    shapes, which means that you can see the edges of invisible
    creatures, and will even make hidden creatures visible.  If
    the hidden creature resists the spell, they are able to
    re-hide themselves after being revealed.  It will not reveal
    any allies of the caster, so the invisible compatriots of the
    caster are safe from detection.


#
"SPELL FIND FAMILIAR"
    Castable by :  mage 2, sorcerer 2

    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A great help to low level magic users, this spell will summon
    a faithful companion for the caster.  The familiar will follow
    the caster until it is dismissed or dies.  The spell can only
    be cast once per day, and the type of creature summoned by
    this spell is dependent on the level of the caster.  The most
    powerful familiar found by this spell is a wolf.


#
"SPELL FEAR"

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell, which is only castable on targets near your own
    level of power, will cause the victim to attempt to run away
    from the encounter.  Essentially, the magic puts a causeless,
    unreasonable fear into the victim, they will have no recollection
    of what caused them to get scared and attempt to 'flee'.


#
"SPELL FEEBLEMIND"
    Castable by :  mage 34, sorcerer 34

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Slightly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    The bane of spell casters and psionists everywhere, this spell
    is a death sentence for anybody who relies on spells to stay
    alive.  If the victim fails to shake off the effect, they
    literally become almost moronic.  The level of intelligence
    drops like a rock, and the ability to cast spells successfully
    plummets.  Most psionist abilities are impossible to attempt
    while under the influence of this spell, and forget about magic
    spells.  Psionists have a defense against the spell using
    'mindblank', otherwise a victim can expect to be in this state
    for a full day.


#
"SPELL FIND TRAPS"
    Castable by :  cleric 16, druid 15, ranger 13

    they are sprung.  It only tends to work on mechanical traps,
    magical ones can still catch the caster by surprise.  The
    spell lasts at least two days, and possible twice as long
    depending on the power of the caster.


#
"SPELL FINGER OF DEATH"

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Fairly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is the epitome of the necromancer's art.  It basically
    attempts to force the soul to vacate the body, through using
    otherworldly minions.  If the target is very unlucky, then the
    soul is instantly ripped free.  Otherwise the struggle to keep the
    minions from taking the soul results in racking pains and actual
    damage to the body.


#
"SPELL FIRE SERVANT"

    This elemental summoning spell brings a servant from the
    plane of fire.  The spell must be cast outdoors, and it
    can't be cast more than once per day.  Using 'order',
    the caster can command this powerful entity, but only for
    a full day, after that the fire servant will regain it's
    own will.


#
"SPELL FIREBALL"
    Castable by :  mage 25, sorcerer 25

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Slightly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Possibly the most well known spell in the world, this
    standard part of the magic user's repertoire is deadly
    and powerful.  Starting out as a pea-sized pebble of
    fire streaking from the caster's finger, it expands
    and when reaching the optimum distance, explodes,
    scorching any creature who is not allied with the caster.
    If the room is dark, any victims who are using infravision
    to see could be blinded, and it could burn the wings of
    any flying race.

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This is a defensive spell, which creates an aura of intense heat
    around you, in the form of red flames.  Any creature attacking
    you will take some damage from the shield.  However, if you
    attempt to create a 'fireshield' while surrounded by another
    defensive shield, like 'chillshield' or 'blade barrier' the
    'fireshield' will supplant the old defensive spell.  Having this
    spell around you allows you to safely attack an opponent who also
    is guarded by a 'fireshield'.

    a whirling mass of flame across a room, burning any creature not
    allied with the caster.  If the spell is cast in a dark room,
    a victim using infravision could be temporarily blinded.  Also
    a winged creature could find themselves unable to fly due to
    burnt wings.

    This spell is a useful tool for most druids, especially during
    the challenges against other druids.  By casting this spell a
    sword made of fire bursts into being.  The power of the blade

    victim has a chance to partially avoid the strike, but the
    target has the chance of going temporarily blind if the room
    was dark and they were using infravision.  Also this spell
    can burn the wings off of winged creatures.

    that can take a great deal of punishment.  The power of the golem
    is determined by the power of the caster, and the spell can only
    be cast twice per day.  The golem will obey the caster for a

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is expensive, but is also a great boon to the
    ranger.  The ranger is able to convince nature to grant
    some of her power to the target.  The corresponding growth
    in size and mass means that the target will be able to hit
    more often in combat, and hit harder when he or she connects
    with an opponent.

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This common spell has a simple effect, to surround the target with
    an opaque globe of darkness.  It best serves to hide the spells that
    might be visible on the target.  For instance, if a creature has the
    spell 'sanctuary' cast on them, 'darkness' would hide the white glow
    that is associated with the 'sanctuary' spell.  Also the races that
    have grown accustomed to living in total darkness can use this spell
    to prevent suffering from the glare of the daylight cast by bright
    light sources.

    cleric must lay out a set of armor on the ground in front of
    him or her.  The pieces of armor that are required for this
    spell are: boots, gloves, jacket, sleeves, leggings, and helm.
    Without all of these parts, they spell will fail.  However, the
    stronger the armor used to fuel the spell, the more powerful the
    golem will be.

"SPELL GUST OF WIND"
    Castable by :  mage 10, sorcerer 10

    Using this spell, the caster can cause a huge gust of wind
    to spring forth suddenly, knocking down the people in the

    but those that don't will have to struggle to their feet
    before they can take any more actions.

"SPELL HARM"
    Castable by :  cleric 25
    Usage       :  cast 'harm' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  100

    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  35
    Casting Time:  Slow
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Nearly Impossible
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    An evil use of the classic healing abilities of clerics,
    this spell is the antithesis of the 'heal' spell.  If the
    caster succeeds in the spell and manages to touch the
    target, it will cause wounds to suddenly appear.  A spell
    of this magnitude can cause grievous injuries, external
    and internal, and can mean a major swing in a battle.
    Siblings of this spell are 'cause light', 'cause serious',
    and 'cause critical'.

"SPELL HASTE"
    Castable by :  mage 23, sorcerer 23

    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    A spell that has a trade-off of benefits and consequences.
    The benefit of this spell is that for a period of time based
    on the power of the caster, the target moves almost twice as
    quickly as normal.  Most noticeable in combat, the target
    will attack more often than usual.  Casting this spell will
    also remove the effects of the 'slow' spell.  The major
    consequence to this spell is that the target is aged a full
    year at the time the spell is cast.  Even if the spell is
    dispelled after only an hour, the target is still going to
    be a year older than they were before the spell was cast.
    Eventually, aging will affect creatures, making them slower,
    weaker, and decrepit.

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Incredibly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    The primary calling of the cleric is to heal, and this spell
    represents that for anybody who worships the gods.  It will
    heal up to 100 points of damage, but it can not heal the
    target to full health, it will always be a little short.
    The gods decree this as a reminder of their power and the
    cost of their healing.  The opposite of this spell is 'harm'
    and the siblings are, 'cure light', 'cure serious', 'cure
    critical'.


#
"SPELL HEAT STUFF"
    Castable by :  druid 23
    Usage       :  cast 'heat stuff' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  Special
    Damage Type :  Fire
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  30
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Casting this spell results great woe for those targets who
    wear metal armor and wield metal weapons.  If the druid
    successfully touches the victim, the metal objects of that
    creature begin to heat up, eventually becoming hot enough
    to scorch flesh badly.  Not only that, but the heating
    of the metal also causes the victim's dexterity to suffer
    because of the constant attempts to avoid the hot equipment.
    The amount of damage caused by this spell is dependent on
    how much metal the victim is wearing.  If the victim manages
    to remove all metal equipment quickly, they will suffer no
    damage.  Otherwise the victim will take up to 2 point of
    damage per metal item worn.

    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    A great investment spell, casting this has many effects.
    First off, it completely refreshes the allies of the caster,
    similar to the 'refresh' or 'second wind' spell.  The second
    effect is to satiate the members of the group, making them
    feel as though they've eaten a wonderful meal and drank the
    purest of waters.


#
"SPELL HOLY ARMOR"

    By calling on the martial gods, a paladin can reinforce his
    own armor with magical force.  The effect lasts for a full
    day, and provides similar level of protection to the spell
    'armor'.


#

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell grants a paladin might infused by the gods.  For
    a period of time determined by the power of the paladin
    invoking the ritual, the paladin will wield great strength,
    which could make them even more deadly when facing their
    evil foes.


#
"SPELL HOLY WORD"
    Castable by :

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Immensely Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A powerful word, filled with the holy might of the gods can
    render weaker creatures helpless, or even dead.  Depending
    on the power of the victims, they will either be struck dead,
    paralyzed, blinded, or stunned for a short time.  However,
    if they are too powerful, they will not be effected at all.
    This is the spell to use against evil creatures, unlike it's
    twin, 'unholy word', which is used against good creatures.


#
"SPELL ICE STORM"
    Castable by :  mage 11, sorcerer 11
    Usage       :  cast 'ice storm'

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Casting this spell creates a brief, localized ice storm to
    appear in the immediate area of the caster.  Any person
    not allied with the caster is pounded by hail and cut by
    sleet.  It lasts only briefly, which is fortunate for it's
    victims.

"SPELL IDENTIFY"

    Usage       :  cast 'identify' <mob> | <obj>

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell is a great boon to gathering knowledge of this world.
    Casting it on an object imparts almost perfect knowledge about
    that object.  Only the most secret of details remains hidden from
    the spell.  It can also be used on individuals, but only of the
    adventuring type.  Casting it on a fellow adventurer grants a great
    deal of knowledge about that person, provided the magic user is
    powerful enough.  However, for a monster the magic is not strong
    enough, the 'know monster' spell is needed.


#
"SPELL INCENDIARY CLOUD"
    Castable by :  mage 45, sorcerer 45
    Usage       :  cast 'incendiary cloud'
    Targets     :  All Mobs in Room
    Damage      :  Level d10

    Casting Time:  Slow
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Immensely Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This powerful spell is the most devastating area effect spell
    known to the world.  Essentially, the caster fills the room
    with an extremely flammable gas, which is released from the
    hands.  Once that process is complete, which takes only a
    moment, he lights a spark, turning the whole area into an
    inferno of indescribable torment.  During that time, if the
    room was dark and a creature was using infravision, they may
    be temporarily blinded.  Also this can burn the wings off of
    flying creatures, leaving them grounded.  The fire burns out
    in a moment, leaving behind only the twisted remains of the
    dead, and the incredibly painful injuries of the living.

"SPELL INFRAVISION"
    Castable by :  mage 8, druid 5, sorcerer 8
    Usage       :  cast 'infravision' <mob>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell, which powerful casters can make last over a week,
    grants the target infravision.  Infravision can make it possible
    to see in the dark without a light source by allowing the target
    to see into the infrared spectrum.  Heat, not light, becomes the
    patterns of the world around him or her.  However, it does not
    help to describe what the room looks like, nor what objects lie
    on the ground, just the creatures who are in the room with you.


#
"SPELL INSECT GROWTH"
    Castable by :  druid 33
    Usage       :  cast 'insect growth' <mob>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room

    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell, which can only be cast outdoors on insects, gives
    those insects a powerful boost.  Basically, it doubles the
    insects in size, making them correspondingly more powerful
    in attacking, more resistant to damage, and less likely to be
    affected by spells.  It lasts a full half day, after which
    time the insect regains it's normal size.  This spell does
    nothing to make the insect follow you, and it can not affect
    insects that are too powerful already.  It is best used on
    insects that are roughly half as powerful as the caster.


#
"SPELL INVIS TO ANIMALS"
    Castable by :  druid 11, ranger 8

    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell is only available to the nature-oriented casters
    of druids and rangers.  For a full day following this spell
    the caster is invisible to all animals, which tends to be
    unintelligent animals such as: predatory animals, fish, birds,
    herbivorous animals, reptiles, kangaroos, insects, and arachnids.
    Once the caster attacks any creature, the invisibility is broken.

#
"SPELL INVIS TO UNDEAD"

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell is only available to the death-oriented caster
    of necromancy.  For a full day following this spell
    the caster is invisible to all undead.  Useful for not
    attracting attention in graveyards.  Once the caster attacks
    any creature, the invisibility is broken.


#
"SPELL INVISIBILITY"
    Castable by :  mage 4, sorcerer 4
    Usage       :  cast 'invisibility' <mob> | <obj>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   Obj in Room
                   Obj in Inventory

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    The classic spell of invisibility makes the caster impossible
    to see without magical intervention.  While the target can still
    be heard, and he or she can take actions that obviously indicate
    their presence, they can not be seen themselves.  The spell can
    also be cast on objects, making them permanently invisible.  If
    it is cast on a person it lasts a maximum of a day, but is
    dispelled if the caster takes offensive actions against another
    creature.  While invisible, the caster is much harder to hit
    in combat, but combat will likely dispel the invisibility, so it
    is only a momentary advantage.


#
"SPELL IRON SKINS"
    Castable by :  druid 20
    Usage       :  cast 'iron skins'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Similar in effect to the spell 'mana shield', this magic grants
    the druid a powerful level of protection.  Casting this spell
    makes the earth disgorge some of it's iron bones into forming
    a malleable, many layered skin around the caster.  The number
    and toughness of the skin layers is determined by the power of
    the druid casting the spell.  As each attack occurs, the skins
    start to flake away, until no protection remains.


#
"SPELL KNOCK"
    Castable by :  mage 3, sorcerer 3
    Usage       :  cast 'knock' <doorname> [<north | east | south |
                                             west | up | down>]
    Targets     :  Door
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  10
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell gives the mage the ability to open locked doors.
    Thieves can do similarly with their non-magical skills, but
    this spell can not affect anything besides a door, where
    the thief can 'pick' the lock of containers as well.  Casting
    this spell requires that the mage know the name of the door
    he or she wants to affect, which may be just "door" or may
    be a more specific name.  If there are multiple doors of the
    same name, the direction (north, east, south, west, up, down)
    can help to identify the right one.
    example: cast 'knock' door south


#
"SPELL KNOW ALIGNMENT"
    Castable by :  mage 7, cleric 4, druid 2, sorcerer 7, paladin 5
    Usage       :  cast 'know alignment' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  10
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    Casting this spell gives you a general idea of how righteous
    and good-hearted a creature is.  If you lack the ability
    to 'detect good' and 'detect evil', this spell will give you
    information you need to not kill something against your own
    character.  It also provides a little better idea of how evil
    or how good a creature is, rather than the white and red
    auras shown by 'detect good' and 'detect evil'.


#
"SPELL KNOW MONSTER"
    Castable by :  mage 9, sorcerer 9
    Usage       :  cast 'know monster' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room

                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is very useful, especially as the power of the caster
    increases.  At low levels, the spell describes only the basics
    of what the target is and how they behave.  At high levels the
    information is very specific and can mean the difference between
    winning and losing a battle.  Information such as race,
    vulnerabilities, immunities, damage, and hit points all become
    available at the higher levels of power.

"SPELL LIFE DRAW"

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Somewhat Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    If the target of this spell does not have any life force,
    like most undead, then it is not effective.  If the target
    does have life force, then the necromancer can do something
    that is repugnant to most people.  He or she can suck the
    life force from another being and transfer it to him or
    herself.  If the target has resistance to draining magic
    or is protected by the spell 'sanctuary', then the amount
    of life stolen is reduced.  For an hour, the necromancer
    can actually steal more life force than he can hold
    naturally, but after an hour, the life force drains away.
    The siblings of this spell are 'life leech', 'life tap',
    and 'soul steal'.

    If the target of this spell does not have any life force,
    like most undead, then it is not effective.  If the target
    does have life force, then the necromancer can do something
    that is repugnant to most people.  He or she can suck the
    life force from another being and transfer it to him or
    herself.  If the target has resistance to draining magic
    or is protected by the spell 'sanctuary', then the amount
    of life stolen is reduced.  For an hour, the necromancer
    can actually steal more life force than he can hold
    naturally, but after an hour, the life force drains away.
    The siblings of this spell are 'life leech', 'life draw',
    and 'soul steal'.

    of mana-powered light appears, and can be used by anybody
    to light the area around them.  The light source from this
    spell lasts at least a day, and as much as three days if
    cast by a high level magic user.  A sibling of this spell
    is the 'continual light' spell.

    A classic of the tales of magic throwing wizards, by pointing
    at a target, this spell will release a bolt of lightning that
    streaks towards the target.  If the victim is lucky, it will
    only graze him or her, nevertheless it will be a very painful
    experience.

"SPELL LOCATE OBJECT"
    Castable by :  cleric 11
    Usage       :  cast 'locate object' <obj>
    Targets     :  Obj in World
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  20
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A very useful spell, it allows the clerics to tap into the
    gods' omniscience briefly, in a limited fashion.  By
    casting this spell, the cleric will receive an idea of
    where any items whose names match their search criteria.
    However, the spell can't find an object if the realm where
    the object exists hasn't been called into being (see
    'term init').  The cleric only receives partial information
    about the whereabouts of the item, but it should be enough
    to whet the appetite of any treasure hunter.


#
"SPELL MAGIC MISSILE"
    Castable by :  mage 1, sorcerer 1
    Usage       :  cast 'magic missile' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  (((Level / 2) + 1) d4) + (Level / 2) + 1
    Damage Type :  Energy
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  15
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    The workhorse of the mage's arsenal, this common spell is a
    good balance between power, cost, and speed.  Although
    simply defeated by the spell 'shield', it otherwise has
    few drawbacks.  A simple transformation of mana into energy,
    it sends darts of magical energy at the target.  The darts
    slam into the target, and the more powerful the caster, the
    more powerful the darts.  A 1st level caster will do 2-5
    points of damage, a 20th level caster will do 22-55 points
    of damage, and a 50th level arch mage will do 52-130 points
    of damage.


#
"SPELL MAJOR INVULNERABILITY"
    Castable by :  mage 27, sorcerer 27, necromancer 30
    Usage       :  cast 'major invulnerability'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  50
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell has a somewhat short duration, lasting only a handful
    of hours, even when cast by the most powerful of mages.  During
    that time, the caster is encased by a globe of magic that makes
    the caster immune to spells of levels 6-10.  Some sample spells
    this works against are: 'fear', 'lightning bolt', and 'weakness'.
    Sibling spells to this one are: 'minor invulnerability' and
    'anti magic shell'.

#
"SPELL MAJOR TRACK"
    Castable by :  mage 20, druid 17, sorcerer 20
    Usage       :  cast 'major track' <mob>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  20
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    Using this spell, the caster can give the target the ability
    to guide themselves magically towards a creature.  Using the
    'track' command, the recipient of this spell can be led, step
    by step, towards the target if the target is in range.  The
    path shows up as a faint green trail, following it will
    take you to the target.  The spell lasts a long time, perhaps
    more than four days when cast by a high level magic user.
    A less powerful version of this spell is 'minor track'.


#
"SPELL MANA"
    Castable by :
    Usage       :  cast 'mana'

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This is not a spell meant for mortals, but it regenerates magical
    power in the caster.


#
"SPELL MANA SHIELD"
    Castable by :  mage 14, sorcerer 14
    Usage       :  cast 'mana shield'
    Targets     :  Self Only
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  50
    Casting Time:  Slow
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A spell with a short duration but potentially life saving effect,
    mana shield is a unique type of armor.  By casting this spell,
    the caster, whose main focus must be as a mage, gains the ability
    to use his magical power as a perfect defense.  While the spell
    lasts, any damage taken by the mage is first absorbed by the
    mana shield, but at the cost of his or her mana supply.  If a mage
    takes 10 points of damage from an attack, his mana shield prevents the
    damage, but the mage's supply of mana is reduced by the same amount
    of 10.  So it is both a benefit and a curse, while it protects the
    caster from harm, it also reduces the ability of the mage to cast
    spells to defeat a foe.  When the mage's mana runs out, so does
    the mana shield.


#
"SPELL MEND BONES"
    Castable by :  necromancer 10
    Usage       :  cast 'mend bones' [<undead mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  11
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is only useful against undead targets, and is
    typically used by the necromancer on his own followers.
    Casting this spell acts like a 'cure critical' cast by
    a cleric, healing between 6-27 points of damage, but
    only on undead, other beings can not benefit from it.


#
"SPELL METEOR SWARM"
    Castable by :  mage 36, sorcerer 36
    Usage       :  cast 'meteor swarm' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  Level d12
    Damage Type :  Fire
    Saving Throw:  vs. Spell for 1/2 Damage
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  35
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Immensely Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    The most powerful spell ever crafted that targets a single victim,
    this spell is a devastating opening strike.  Basically it calls
    the wrath of the heavens down on the target.  The target pointed
    at by the mage becomes the landing point of magically created
    meteors falling from above at speeds greater than any diving
    falcon.  The meteors are very hot, and cause horrific burns
    to the victim.  If the victim is lucky, they might avoid the
    full force of the swarm.


#
"SPELL MINOR CREATION"
    Castable by :  mage 8, sorcerer 8
    Usage       :  cast 'minor creation' <sword | shield | bag |
                                          raft | barrel | bread>

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Using his own reserves of magical power, the caster can change
    mana into material items.  The material items able to be crafted
    by this are limited, but can be useful.  The raft can be used to
    float on a lake or river, the barrel comes filled with water, the
    bag can hold items, the bread can be eaten, and the sword and shield,
    although not very powerful, might be better than nothing in a pinch.


#
"SPELL MINOR INVULNERABILITY"

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell has a somewhat short duration, lasting only a handful
    of hours, even when cast by the most powerful of mages.  During
    that time, the caster is encased by a globe of magic that makes
    the caster immune to spells of levels 1-5.  Some sample spells
    this works against are: 'magic missile', 'chill touch', and
    'scare'.  Sibling spells to this one are: 'major invulnerability'
    and 'anti magic shell'.


#
"SPELL MINOR TRACK"

    cast by a high level magic user.  A more powerful version of

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Immensely Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This powerful area affect spell is a deadly magic available
    to necromancers.  By releasing his own darkness and making it
    a tangible cloud, the necromancer damages the very souls of
    all non-allied creatures in the room, provided they have
    unprotected souls.  In some rare instances, the cloud of
    darkness can instantly snuff out the soul of a victim, but
    regardless, the victims of this spell never forget this
    devastating spell.

    Casting this spell brings a servant to follow and aid the caster.
    Anything the magic user wants the follower to do, he can use the
    command 'order' to make it happen.  The creature appears out of
    thin air and will follow the caster for a period of time determined
    by the charisma of the summoner.  Clever use of these followers can
    mean the difference between living and dying.  This version of the
    monster summoning spells summons a goblin.  The follower can be
    released by the 'dismiss' command.

    Casting Time:  Slow
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Incredibly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell, which does no damage but it incredibly deadly,
    can instantly make the target immobile.  If the target fails
    to resist the spell, they are effectively helpless.  Fully
    aware, but unable to take any actions.  Not so much as utter
    a syllable, twitch a finger, shuffle the feet, etc.  During
    this time, any opponents are free to beat the living crap
    out of the victim, with no fear of retribution.  If cast by
    a person, the spell lasts no less than a day, and can last
    easily over two days.  Being resistant to hold magics
    can make this spell less effective, being immune can make
    this spell a waste of time.

    A truly unique transportation spell, it allows the druid, and
    any creature allied with the druid to move about the world
    through the access points of specific trees.  By standing in
    the room of one tree, and specifying which tree he or she
    wishes to emerge from, the druid can step into one tree and
    step out of another.  The trees are named rather specifically,
    but it is a secret known only to the druids what they are,
    except the tree in the Market Square of Karsinya, which is
    called Tiberius.

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Fairly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is used to put a magical poison into the veins of
    an opponent, or to make a piece of food, or a container of
    drink deadly.  Becoming poisoned will sap the strength of
    the victim, and also cause them damage, but it doesn't really
    hurt them except when another hour passes.  The poisoning
    can last a very long time, over four days when cast by an
    adept, and each successful casting of the spell makes it last
    even longer.  The only way to rid yourself of this poisoning
    is through time, the 'remove poison' spell, the 'nullify'
    spell, or a potion.  Halflings are resistant to the damage
    caused by this spell.

"SPELL PORTAL"
    Castable by :  mage 43, sorcerer 43

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A powerful spell, that can save great time and effort,
    the 'portal' spell will create a gate between two
    places.  By carefully releasing a great deal of magical
    energy and focussing solely on the target, the mage can
    create a shimmering doorway, which can be accessed using
    'enter portal'.  The portal must originally target a
    creature, the mana forms a link between the caster and
    the target.  Once that link is established, the magic
    will tie to the location of both parties, but only in
    the direction of the flow of magic power.  This means
    that the portal and the end point are stationary, and
    you can only travel one way, from the caster to the
    target.  There are several ways that the spell can
    fail, such as: if the caster and the target are on
    different planes, the target is in a room that repels
    the magical link, the target itself is too powerful
    to successfully link with, or the gods have denied
    the ability to bend space.  You can 'look portal'
    to determine what location was successfully linked.

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell can be very powerful, but is completely random in nature.
    By releasing magical energy, in a barely constrained state, the caster
    can produce many types of effects, which show themselves as beams
    of light.  Each creature not allied with the caster is struck by one
    beam.  The colors of the beams of light and the effects are:

    Red, Orange, Yellow - These will cause damage to the victim, the
    victim may Save vs. Spell for 1/2 Damage.

    Green - This beam will 'poison' the target, but they can Save vs. Poison
    to Negate.

    Blue - This beam will 'paralyze' the target it strikes unless they Save
    vs. Paralyzation to Negate.

    Indigo - This beam will 'feeblemind' the target unless they Save vs.
    Spell to Negate.

    Violet - This beam will cause the target to randomly 'teleport' to some
    other location in the world.  They can Save vs. Spell to Negate.

    protective screen.  It doesn't last long, even a powerful
    caster will only be protected for a handful of hours.  If the
    caster already is resistant to cold, then this spell does not
    provide any more protection.

    attacks.  Any damage taken from an attack is reduced by half by
    this protective screen.  It doesn't last long, even a powerful
    caster will only be protected for a handful of hours.  If the
    caster already is resistant to electricity, then this spell does
    not provide any more protection.

    This spell provides some general combat benefits when fighting
    evil creatures.  By forming a weak barrier around the target, it

    pause to give the protected person combat bonuses, both to hit
    evil opponents, and to dodge the attacks of evil opponents.  This
    spell lasts a full day.  This spell is the single target variant of
    'protection from evil group' and the opposite of 'protection from
    good'.

    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A single word of power, infused with magical energy, can have
    devastating effect on the target.  The difference between this
    and the spell 'blindness' is that the target does not get a chance
    to avoid the effect.  Either they are weak and able to be affected,
    or they are immune to the spell entirely.  Another spell of the
    same type is 'power word kill'.

    or they are immune to the spell entirely.  Another spell of the

    A very useful spell, able to be cast be many different classes, it
    allows a tired target to continue travelling and fighting.  This
    spell is similar to 'second wind', just less useful and efficient,
    but is castable at much lower levels.  Casting this spell will
    recover an amount of move based on the power of the caster.

    One of the most powerful spells in the realm, the druid can bring
    a deceased person back to life, but it may not be to the life they
    are accustomed.  This spell, which can only be cast outdoors in a
    forest, can also only be cast on the corpse of an adventurer.
    When cast, the druid will be reduced to near death, and weakened
    of all magical ability.  But the adventurer will be brought back
    to life in a random form.  It could be as an elf, or a orc, or a
    giant, or of many other possibilities.  There is no way to control
    the form chosen.  The newly reincarnated adventurer will be weaker
    after the ordeal for all time, his or her constitution taking a
    permanent penalty.

    Technical Details:  After dying, the player who is being reincarnated
    must *NOT* enter the game, they *MUST* remain at the menu screen.  Do
    *NOT* hit 1 to re-enter the game, stay at the menu until you are
    returned to the game automatically.

"SPELL REMOVE CURSE"

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell is the only way, short of dying, of divesting oneself
    of cursed items.  Casting this spell allows a cursed object to
    be handled normally.  A player can 'remove', 'drop', 'put', 'get',
    donate, and 'junk' a formerly cursed item just like any other item.
    If casting the spell on another creature, it will remove the effects
    of the 'curse' spell and if they have a cursed object worn or wielded
    the spell will remove the curse on that object.  If the object is in
    the inventory of the caster, or on the ground, the object must be
    targeted.  For objects that are cursed, but can not worn or wielded
    by another creature, a spell scroll created by a cleric using 'scribe'
    can be recited by that creature on the object.

    cast it on themselves.


#
"SPELL REMOVE POISON"

    Usage       :  cast 'remove poison' <mob> | <food/drink obj>

    This spell can cure a target creature whose blood burns with
    poison.  Successfully casting this spell will purge the target
    of all poison, no matter how long the poison was supposed to
    last.  Casting this spell on a piece of food or on a drink
    container will make the item safe to eat and drink.


#
"SPELL RESURRECTION"

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell can be cast on any corpse, whether an adventurer or
    a former opponent.  If cast on a former opponent, the corpse
    will rise and serve you, for the cost of 25000 gold. Be careful,
    if the creature has magical protections or was too powerful in
    life, it will rise from the dead, but refuse to serve you.  They
    will follow the caster for a period of time determined by the
    charisma of the caster.  If cast on a fellow adventurer, this
    spell costs the caster 75000 gold coins, and drains the caster of
    almost all health, magic, and stamina.  The victim will also be
    drained similarly, and will lose some of their constitution.

    Technical Details:  After dying, the player who is being reincarnated
    must leave the game entirely. Disconnect from the mud completely.  Do
    not remain at the menu screen, do not re-enter the game.  The best
    thing to do is to exit the game (hit 0 at the menu screen), and log
    in with a different character to watch and make sure you get
    resurrected.  After successfully resurrection, you can log back in
    with that character.

    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    The workhorse of the cleric's arsenal, this spell is a must have
    tool for any adventuring party.  Calling on the gods to protect
    the target, it creates a nimbus of white light, that blunts any
    and all attacks against the individual.  When benefiting from
    this spell, the target suffers only 1/2 damage from any attack,
    even magical attacks.  Only a few rare psionic attacks are not
    affected by this spell.  The spell lasts only a few hours, not
    even a handful, but during that time, the gods protect the target.


#
"SPELL SCARE"

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Somewhat Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A basic spell, of only limited use, it forces a very weak target
    to flee from the caster.  Basically a burst of fear, powered by
    magical energy, causes the target to run away, but immediately
    afterwards, they return to normal, and will remember what happened.


#
"SPELL SCOURGE OF THE WARLOCK"
    Castable by :  necromancer 29
    Usage       :  cast 'scourge of the warlock' [<mob>]

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    The darkest devotion of the minions of darkness, this spell is
    involves accepting a token of the Dark Lord.  Worn on the eyes,
    it is a mask, made of a magically created forked tongue.  So,
    the first time you cast this spell, you must not be wearing any
    object on your eyes, or else the spell will fail.  The tongue
    might have a special boon, granted by the Dark Lord, but it
    allows the scourge to be cast.  The scourge will poison the
    target, and then burn out most of the poison immediately,
    causing great damage, the scourge will leave lingering
    traces of poison in the veins, much like the 'poison' spell.


#

    A more powerful and versatile version of the 'refresh' spell, this
    will make the target less tired, and can be cast during combat.  Once
    cast the target will be ready to continue travelling and fighting, by
    replenishing their move.


#
"SPELL SENSE LIFE"

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell is the only way of noticing a hidden creature in the room
    with you.  A hidden creature will reveal itself as a life form, but
    without the spell 'true sight', you will not be able to target the
    creature.  You will only know that something is there, not what
    the name of that something is.  This spell can last an incredibly
    long time when cast by a high level cleric, there have been cases
    of the spell lasting more than 10 days.


#
"SPELL SHADOW STEP"

    Casting Time:  Medium

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell allows a necromancer to use the shadows to remove
    him or herself from combat instantly and safely.  When this
    spell is cast, the necromancer will be transported into an
    adjacent room, provided that room is relatively safe.  A quick
    duck into the shadows, emerging nearby, it is an alternative
    to fleeing like a common fighter.


#
"SPELL SHIELD"
    Castable by :  mage 1, sorcerer 1
    Usage       :  cast 'shield' <mob>
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Somewhat Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    One of the simplest magical spells, this provides a perfect
    defense against the spell 'magic missile'.  It also provides
    a small level of protection against physical attacks by slightly
    stiffening the air around the caster.  The spell lasts for a
    period of time determined by the power of the caster.


#
"SPELL SHILLELAGH"
    Castable by :  druid 3

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell can take a plain club and change it into a magical
    version called a shillelagh.  This only works on non-magical
    clubs, but it is permanent.  It does not create anything
    incredibly powerful, nor does it improve as the caster gets
    more powerful, but it might be handy in times of need.


#
"SPELL SHOCKING GRASP"
    Castable by :  mage 2, sorcerer 2
    Usage       :  cast 'shocking grasp' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  1-8 + Level

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This requires that the caster touches the target, but if he
    or she does, this spell can zap the victim pretty good.  The
    mage builds up a large amount of magical energy, and then
    transforms it into electricity as he touches the target.  The
    resulting shock is enough to stop a heart.  Or start one.


#
"SPELL SILENCE"
    Castable by :  mage 21, cleric 23, druid 25, sorcerer 21
    Usage       :  cast 'silence' [<mob>]

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Immensely Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    The bane of spell throwers everywhere, this spell makes the
    target unable to make any sound.  If the target doesn't
    manage to shake off the effect, no spells can be cast,
    no words can be spoken until the spell wears off, which
    is dependent on the power of the caster.

    This spell strips the strength from the target and gives it
    to the necromancer caster.  The amount of strength taken is
    somewhat random, determined by the will of the victim to
    resist the dark magic.  The spell lasts for about a third
    of a day, at which time the victim gets his or her strength
    back.  The spell can not target fellow adventurers.

"SPELL SLEEP"
    Castable by :  mage 3, sorcerer 3
    Usage       :  cast 'sleep' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room

    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Somewhat Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    By casting this spell, the magic user forces the target to
    suddenly become tired and fall asleep.  The target can
    resist the effects, and will know what the mage attempted
    to do.

"SPELL SLOWNESS"
    Castable by :  mage 19, sorcerer 19
    Usage       :  cast 'slowness' <mob>

    The opposite of the spell 'haste', this spell will cause the
    target to move about half as fast as normal.  It is especially
    noticeable in combat, when the opponent only gets about half
    as many attacks.  The duration of this effect is about a double
    handful of hours, which can feel like twice as long to the
    victim.


#
"SPELL SLOW POISON"
    Castable by :  druid 6, paladin 10, ranger 10
    Usage       :  cast 'slow poison' <mob>

    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell, which lasts a full day, will severely reduce the
    damage caused by being poisoned.  While a 'remove poison'
    would be better, this can help to keep the victim alive until
    the appropriate remedy can be found.

"SPELL SNARE"
    Castable by :  druid 8, ranger 5
    Usage       :  cast 'snare' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent

    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This interesting spell can only be cast in the outdoors,
    specifically in a forest.  But if those criteria are met
    the druid or ranger can attempt to convince Nature to
    help them in their fight.  Vines and supple bushes will
    reach towards the target.  If he or she doesn't evade
    them, they will instantly reduce their move down to
    zero, unable to walk, flee, and soon unable to fight at
    all.  As soon as the victim regains some move, they are
    able to break free of the vines easily.


#
"SPELL SOUL STEAL"
    Castable by :  necromancer 27
    Usage       :  cast 'soul steal' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  20
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is amazing, and makes a necromancer very powerful.
    By reaching into the soul of a target with his dark magics,
    the necromancer can grab ahold of the magical essence of the
    target, and pull it out.  Once that has happened, he can
    absorb it for his own use, replenishing his own magical
    reservoir.  The amount stripped is random, but usually is
    enough to at least pay the caster back for the cost of the
    'soul steal' spell.  Sometimes it is enough to power expensive
    spells.  The amount is dictated by the strength of the target's
    will to hold on to their mana.


#
"SPELL SPEAK WITH PLANTS"
    Castable by :  druid 7
    Usage       :  cast 'speak with plants' <tree obj>
    Targets     :  Obj in Room
    Damage      :  -

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This minor spell doesn't have much use, except when taken
    into conjunction with the spell 'plant gate'.  Since
    the spell 'plant gate' requires a druid to know the given
    name of a tree, this spell can be used to help the druid
    to discover the names of any tree he or she runs across.
    Only trees can be talked to this way, and they usually
    don't have too much to say.


#
"SPELL SPECTRAL SHIELD"
    Castable by :  necromancer 4
    Usage       :  cast 'spectral shield'

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Somewhat Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This minor spell creates a ghostly suit of armor that forms
    just over the current armor of the necromancer.  It is light
    enough to not hinder the caster at all, but it also does not
    give much protection.  It lasts longer if cast by a more
    powerful necromancer, potentially more than two days at the
    height of mortal power.


#
"SPELL STONE SKIN"
    Castable by :  mage 26, sorcerer 26, necromancer 32
    Usage       :  cast 'stone skin'

    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  -
    Aggressive  :  No
    Mana Cost   :  40
    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A powerful defensive spell available to some spell casters,
    this enables the caster to magically reinforce his or her
    skin.  While not truly turning the skin to stone, it takes
    on some of the color and properties of stone, and makes it
    much harder for enemies to successfully hit the caster.
    As a side benefit, this also gives the caster some
    resistance against stabbing and piercing attacks.  It
    should reduce the damage by these types of attacks by
    one half.  The duration of the effect is governed strictly
    by the power of the caster.


#
"SPELL STRENGTH"
    Castable by :  mage 6, sorcerer 6
    Usage       :  cast 'strength' <mob>

    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    A surprisingly simple transformation of magical energy into
    chemical energy allows the magic user to make a creature
    physically stronger.  The period of time is determined by
    the power of the caster.  The actual gain of strength is
    determined somewhat by what kind of role the target is
    involved in.  For instance, warrior types can receive
    a bigger strength boost than a mage.


#
"SPELL SUCCOR"
    Castable by :  mage 24, cleric 23, sorcerer 24

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Casting this spell brings a scroll into being.  The scroll
    is a simple one, containing the few magical syllables needed
    to cast the spell 'word of recall'.  Another person could
    then 'recite' the scroll to feel the effects of the 'word of
    recall' spell.

#
"SPELL SUIT OF BONE"
    Castable by :  necromancer 3
    Usage       :  cast 'suit of bone'

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell basically creates magically strengthened bones
    from the darkness, and uses them to reinforce the existing
    armor of the caster.  The bones usually match the armor,
    so that a rib cage will form over the breastplate, and
    a femur over the leggings, etc.  The protection provided
    by this spell is a nice benefit, at least twice as much
    as provided by 'spectral shield'.  The bones stay in place
    for a full day after casting.


#
"SPELL SUMMON"
    Castable by :  mage 27, cleric 19, sorcerer 27

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This useful spell is a very popular utility spell.  By
    casting this with a fellow adventurer as the target, the
    target is immediately brought to your location.  There is
    no failure, except to fail the spell normally, through losing
    concentration.  However, it can also be used to bring an
    unwilling target, like a monster.  If that is the case, then
    the target receives the chance to resist the spell.  There
    are many conditions regarding the summoning of creatures.
    They must be on the same plane of existence as you.  If either
    you or the target are in a peaceful room, like the Reception,
    then summoning is impossible.  If you are underwater, or
    floating in mid-air, summoning isn't possible, you must have
    contact with the ground to send out the questing magic.  If
    the target is more than mortal, then summoning is impossible.
    If you are in a constricted space, then it is impossible to
    summon another person to it.  If the target is fighting, then
    they can not be summoned from the combat.  If the room they
    are in is magically protected, or the room you are in is
    magically protected, you can not summon the target.
    Rarely, the gods decide to make the planes shift and swirls,
    which also means that any extra-dimensional travel is
    impossible.  Despite all these restrictions, this is still
    a very useful spell, which can save a lot of time.


#
"SPELL SUNRAY"
    Castable by :  druid 27
    Usage       :  cast 'sunray' [<mob>]
    Targets     :  Mob in Room
                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  Special
    Damage Type :  Energy
    Saving Throw:  vs. Spell for 1/2 Damage
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  15
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Moderate
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell has several effects, but the most deadly is
    reserved for undead monsters.  A blazing shaft of sunlight
    streams from above, bathing all in the room.  Any person
    not allied with the caster has a chance to be temporarily
    blinded by the spell.  If a creature is wearing equipment
    that doesn't tolerate sunlight, like drow equipment, then
    the equipment will likely be destroyed by the sunray.
    Finally, if the creature is undead or something like a
    myconoid, then it will take anywhere from 6 through 48
    points of damage.  The creature targeted by the spell
    will likely take more damage than those on the periphery
    of the sunray.


#
"SPELL TELEPORT"
    Castable by :  mage 17, sorcerer 17
    Usage       :  cast 'teleport' [<mob>]

                   If Fighting: Automatically Target Opponent
    Damage      :  -
    Damage Type :  -
    Saving Throw:  vs. Spell to Negate
    Aggressive  :  Yes
    Mana Cost   :  33
    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Fairly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell can be a last ditch effort to avoid death.  Not
    recommended unless no other options present themselves.  By
    casting this spell the magic user sends a jolt of magical
    energy into the immediate world around him or her.  The end
    result of that jolt is to displace the caster from his or her
    location and allow the magic to carry him or her away to
    some other location.  The location is completely random, it
    can be anywhere on the same plane of existence, as long as
    no magical or natural barriers exist to prevent the
    translocation.  While that guarantees not ending up
    materializing inside of a boulder, it does not mean that you
    won't end up in the air above a ravine, or landing in the
    midst of a ravenous pack of wolves.  The fact that this
    spell can be cast in combat means that you might save yourself
    an agonizing death.  However, you also might jump from the
    frying pan into the fire.  If it is cast on another being,
    that being can resist the displacement effect of the jolt,
    and remain in the same location.

"SPELL TELEPORT WITHOUT ERROR"
    Castable by :  mage 30, sorcerer 30, necromancer 35
    Usage       :  cast 'teleport without error' <mob>

    This powerful dimensional magic allows the caster to send any
    creature to the astral plane.  Anybody who is grouped with
    the target is also shifted to the astral plane.  In the
    astral plane, travel throughout the world is possible by
    entering the color pools, but blindly jumping into pools is
    not recommended for the wise adventurer.  Only grouped
    individuals can be sent, if you cast this spell and the
    target does not get shifted to the other plane, check to
    make sure the target is grouped, even if only with him or
    herself.


#
"SPELL TRACE CORPSE"
    Castable by :  necromancer 11
    Usage       :  cast 'trace corpse' <corpse obj>

    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    An odd spell, that shows just how closely necromancers are
    linked to death, 'trace corpse' allows the caster to gain
    information about any recent corpse.  If possible, the
    caster will actually be able to see the place where the
    corpse now lies.


#
"SPELL TRANSPORT VIA PLANT"
    Castable by :  druid 10

    Similar to 'plant gate', this spell allows the druid to
    teleport him or herself from one tree to another tree.
    If the druid is standing in the same room with one of
    the many trees spread across the realm, he can name a
    target tree in casting this spell and be instantly
    transported to that tree.  There is no particular limit
    to this spell, the trees can even be on separate planes,
    and it is not considered multi-dimensional travel, so
    that when the planes are fuzzy and shifted, the druid
    can still travel.  The names of the trees of the realms
    is a closely guarded druid secret, but it is widely
    rumored that the name of the Karsinya tree in Market
    Square is called Tiberius.


#
"SPELL TRAVELLING"
    Castable by :  druid 10, ranger 15
    Usage       :  cast 'travelling' Self Only

    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    An alternative to having to fly everywhere, this spell gives
    the druid or ranger the ability to travel easily over even
    the most difficult of outdoor terrain.  While remaining
    on the ground, this spell allows the druid or ranger to
    move as though they were walking across a level, easy path.
    While others may tire quickly while walking through mountains,
    the caster of this spell feels only as tired as though he
    were walking inside a hallway of a building.


#
"SPELL TREE"
    Castable by :  druid 15
    Usage       :  cast 'tree'
    Targets     :  Self Only

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    Truly demonstrating the affinity with nature that a druid
    possesses, this spell allows the druid to transform his
    very body into an actual tree.  The power of the druid
    directly corresponds to the power of the tree form.  And
    the tree is of course ambulatory, usually with a lot of
    attacks and a high resistance to damage.  The druid
    can return to his or her own form immediately by using
    the command 'return'.


#
"SPELL TREE TRAVEL"
    Castable by :  druid 8
    Usage       :  cast 'tree travel'
    Targets     :  Self Only

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is oddly named, but it's effect is simple.  Casting
    'tree travel' actually results in becoming slightly closer to
    nature than normal.  The effect of this is to give the caster
    a small edge in detecting dangers in combat, making them a
    little harder to hit.  The spell lasts for a full day, and
    costs little in terms of magical power, so most wise druids
    will maintain it constantly.


#
"SPELL TRUE SIGHT"
    Castable by :  cleric 19, druid 24
    Usage       :  cast 'true sight' <mob>

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  No
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  Yes

    This spell is a great boon to the target.  Essentially
    this spell means that nothing is obscured from the target.
    Being under the effect of this spell means that they can
    see invisible creatures, see in the dark, and it protects
    against heat sources from blinding creatures with
    infravision.  However, it does not protect against being
    blinded.  A creature who is under the effect of this spell
    and the spell 'sense life' will be able to target hidden
    creatures by name.


#
"SPELL TURN"
    Castable by :  cleric 1, druid 12, paladin 10
    Usage       :  cast 'turn' <mob>

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  No
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Very Easy
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell gives the cleric, druid, or paladin the
    power to make an undead creature flee the area.  The
    caster must be more powerful than the target, if the
    caster is significantly more powerful than the target,
    then the victim is far more likely to succumb to the
    spell.


#
"SPELL UNHOLY WORD"
    Castable by :
    Usage       :  cast 'unholy word'
    Targets     :  All Mobs in Room
    Damage      :  Special

    Casting Time:  Medium
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Immensely Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    A powerful word, filled with the unholy might of the gods can
    render weaker creatures helpless, or even dead.  Depending
    on the power of the victims, they will either be struck dead,
    paralyzed, blinded, or stunned for a short time.  However,
    if they are too powerful, they will not be effected at all.
    This is the spell to use against good creatures, unlike it's
    twin, 'holy word', which is used against evil creatures.

"SPELL UNSUMMON"
    Castable by :  necromancer 7
    Usage       :  cast 'unsummon' [<mob>]

    Casting Time:  Fast
    Combat Cast :  Yes
    Accumulative:  Yes
    Difficulty  :  Slightly Difficult
    Scribe/Brew :  No

    This spell is very useful to a necromancer, especially one
    that uses his mastery of the undead to make many followers.
    By casting this spell on an undead follower, the necromancer
    can use the dark power that animates the dead to heal himself
    and to recover magical energy.  The amount of healing is
    random, but should be between 6 and 27 points of damage and
    he can regain a similar amount of mana.  A clever necromancer
    will become excellent at this spell and at the spell 'animate
    dead'.

    thereby gaining more powers and strength.

#
"TERM EXP CAP"

    This term refers to the artificial limits on the amount of
    experience that can be earned by an adventurer for defeating
    a single creature.  The formula used to determine this
    is based on the experience you need for the next level.
    You can not earn more than 10% of the experience needed for
    the next level in one battle.  So if you need 30,000 experience
    to advance from level 5 to level 6, you can not earn more than
    3,000 experience per fight.  This is based on the overall
    experience needed, not your current amount needed.  There is
    a cap to this amount, which is modified by how many people
    are in your group.  The limit for killing a mob solo is 150,000
    experience, regardless of how much you need to level.  If you
    are in a group with one other person, the limit is raised to
    250,000 experience.  An extra 100,000 experience is added for
    each additional group member.  So if you have a group with
    4 people, you would have a limit of 550,000 experience for
    one fight.

    This term refers to the idea that you are specifically
    adventuring to kill many mobs worth a lot of experience.
    This is a time when you maximize the amount of experience
    you earn in the minimum amount of time, exploration and
    equipment are not factors.

#
"TERM EXPERIENCE"

    Experience is generally considered a noun in mudding terms,
    and the more powerful a creature is, the more experience
    they are worth.  Gaining experience is the only way to advance
    in level, thereby gaining more powers and strength.

#
"TERM EXPLORER"

    This term refers to a mid level mortal, who is just beginning to feel
    comfortable in their role and in exploring some of the world around them.
    There are a group of distinctions that can help to narrow down how
    powerful an adventurer is.

    Apprentice
    Pilgrim
    Explorer
    Adventurer
    Mystical
    Hero

#
"TERM FS"

    This term refers to the spell 'fireshield'.  If you hear
    that a mob is "fs'd" the speaker is referring to the idea
    that the mob is protected by the 'fireshield' spell.

#
"TERM GOD"

    This is a generic term for any players who are 51st level or
    more.  The more common term is 'immortal'.  Immortals are the
    observers and administrators of the mud, they can not adventure,
    kill, or interact in any meaningful way with the world.  The
    higher the level of the immortal, the more power and authority
    they wield.  Earning immortality is a combination of demonstrating
    knowledge and experience of the mud and showing an appreciation of
    the culture and the goals of the mud.  Typically, any mortal who
    has earned over 200 million experience can apply for immortality,
    but it is up to the discretion of an 'implementor' whether the
    application is successful.

#
"TERM GUILD"

    This term refers to a place where levels can be gained and skills
    can be earned from a 'guildmaster'.  It is only at the appropriate
    guild where you can gain new levels, if you have enough experience
    as a mage to advance to the next level, you must go to the mage
    guild and find the mage guildmaster.  The phrase "guild hall"
    usually refers to a place where many guilds can be found close to
    one another.  Currently, the guild hall that is most commonly
    used by low level adventurers can be found west of the Meeting
    Square in the main town of Karsinya.

#
"TERM GUILDMASTER"

    This term refers to any specific teacher of a set of skills.  The
    mage guildmaster can advance a mage character in level using the
    'gain' command and teach new spells using the 'practice' command.
    The primary usage of this word is in conjunction with a single class,
    such as above.  But it can also be applied to any number of other
    teachers who do not teach to only one class, but rather have skills
    that can be taught to many different kinds of characters.  Usually
    these teachers are referred to by name, rather than as a guildmaster
    so as to differentiate between them.

#
"TERM HERO"

    This term refers to a high level mortal, who has spent considerable
    time and energy in advancing to the height of mortal power.  There
    are a group of distinctions that can help to narrow down how powerful
    an adventurer is.

    Apprentice
    Pilgrim
    Explorer
    Adventurer
    Mystical
    Hero

#
"TERM HIT REGEN"

    This term refers to two related things, the first is how many
    hitpoints are gained on a 'tick'.  Every mud hour, creatures regain
    some of their lost hitpoints, mana, and move.  So if someone asks
    you "How is your hit regen?" they are asking how many hitpoints
    do you regenerate naturally per 'tick'.  The second is
    an effect that some equipment has that can alter how many hit
    points are regenerated per 'tick'.  So if somebody asks you what
    the 'stats' are on a helmet, you can reply "Oh, it's +1 hitroll
    and +5 hit regen."

#
"TERM HIT-N-DAM"

    This term refers to an effect that can be present on equipment.
    It is shorthand for 'hitroll' and 'damroll'.  Weapons are the
    most common type of equipment with this particular effect, and
    it represents an equal amount of the modifier being applied to
    both 'hitroll' and 'damroll'.  So a weapon that is listed as:
    HIT-N-DAM By 5 means that it is +5 to hitroll and +5 to damroll.

#
"TERM HITPOINTS"

    This term refers to the concept of how healthy a creature is.
    A creature with a lot of hitpoints can take a great deal of
    abuse before dying.  A creature with a few hitpoints can die
    far more easily.  There are a list of classifications of how
    healthy a creature appears to be, but it is only relative to
    the total number of hitpoints the creature has.  A wounded
    creature with a lot of hitpoints could have potentially
    more hitpoints than a creature with low hitpoints who is in
    perfect condition.

    excellent
    few scratches
    small wounds
    wounded
    big nasty
    badly wounded
    awful
    bleeding

#
"TERM HITROLL"

    This term refers to a couple related things.  Hitroll itself
    refers to the increased or decreased chance to successfully
    hit an opponent in combat.  So if an item has a positive
    hitroll effect, it will make the character more likely to
    hit opponents in combat.  Hitroll in a general manner can
    refer to the overall hitroll bonus sum of a character, which
    can be viewed in general terms using the 'attribute' command.

    Quite bad
    Pretty lousy
    Not Much of one
    Not bad
    Pretty good
    Damn good
    Very good
    Extremely good
    Magnificent

#
"TERM HND"

    This term is an abbreviation for the term 'hit-n-dam',
    referring to an effect that can be present on equipment.
    It is shorthand for 'hitroll' and 'damroll'.  Weapons are the
    most common type of equipment with this particular effect, and
    it represents an equal amount of the modifier being applied to
    both 'hitroll' and 'damroll'.  So a weapon that is listed as:
    HIT-N-DAM By 5 means that it is +5 to hitroll and +5 to damroll.

#
"TERM HP"

    This term is an abbreviation for the term 'hitpoints'.
    This term refers to the concept of how healthy a creature is.
    A creature with a lot of hitpoints can take a great deal of
    abuse before dying.  A creature with a few hitpoints can die
    far more easily.  There are a list of classifications of how
    healthy a creature appears to be, but it is only relative to
    the total number of hitpoints the creature has.  A wounded
    creature with a lot of hitpoints could have potentially
    more hitpoints than a creature with low hitpoints who is in
    perfect condition.

    excellent
    few scratches
    small wounds
    wounded
    big nasty
    badly wounded
    awful
    bleeding

#
"TERM HUGE"

    This term refers to a specific flag attached to a mobile.  It
    means that the mob will be too large for normal sized adventurers
    to do things such as 'bash', 'backstab', and 'legsweep'.  Only
    adventurers who are huge themselves, such as half-giants can
    still 'bash', 'backstab', and 'legsweep' opponents.

#
"TERM IC"

    This term is an abbreviation for "in character", which refers
    to the idea that everything communicated by a character should
    be in the voice of that character.  When speaking "in character"
    your character only says and knows things that the character
    would say or know, not what the player controlling the character
    would say or know.  This usually means at the very least that
    a character does not talk about things like their dogs, their
    apartments, and their computers.  If you really wish to talk
    about one of these things, there is a special communication
    channel dedicated to the purpose called 'ooc'.

#
"TERM IMM"

    This is a generic term for any players who are 51st level or
    more.  The more common term is 'immortal'.  Immortals are the
    observers and administrators of the mud, they can not adventure,
    kill, or interact in any meaningful way with the world.  The
    higher the level of the immortal, the more power and authority
    they wield.  Earning immortality is a combination of demonstrating
    knowledge and experience of the mud and showing an appreciation of
    the culture and the goals of the mud.  Typically, any mortal who
    has earned over 200 million experience can apply for immortality,
    but it is up to the discretion of an 'implementor' whether the
    application is successful.

#
"TERM IMMORT"

    This is a generic term for any players who are 51st level or
    more.  The more common term is 'immortal'.  Immortals are the
    observers and administrators of the mud, they can not adventure,
    kill, or interact in any meaningful way with the world.  The
    higher the level of the immortal, the more power and authority
    they wield.  Earning immortality is a combination of demonstrating
    knowledge and experience of the mud and showing an appreciation of
    the culture and the goals of the mud.  Typically, any mortal who
    has earned over 200 million experience can apply for immortality,
    but it is up to the discretion of an 'implementor' whether the
    application is successful.

#
"TERM IMMORTAL"

    This is a generic term for any players who are 51st level or
    more.  Immortals are the observers and administrators of the mud,
    they can not adventure, kill, or interact in any meaningful way with
    the world.  The higher the level of the immortal, the more power and
    authority they wield.  Earning immortality is a combination of
    demonstrating knowledge and experience of the mud and showing an
    appreciation of the culture and the goals of the mud.  Typically, any
    mortal who has earned over 200 million experience can apply for
    immortality, but it is up to the discretion of an 'implementor'
    whether the application is successful.

#
"TERM IMMORTALITY"

    This term refers to the state of having moved beyond the mortal coil
    and becoming an 'immortal'.  Immortality is a goal for some players
    who wish to have input and responsibility in how the mud operates.
    Immortality is reached at level 51, and the more work performed by
    the 'immortal', the more advancement is gained.  Reaching immortality
    is a combination of showing a significant amount of experience and
    dedication to the mud in the mortal realm, and being advanced by
    an 'implementor', which is a very high level immortal.

#
"TERM IMMUNE"

    This term refers to the idea that a creature can be completely
    unaffected by certain damage types or effects.  This could be
    naturally occurring, such as a frost giant being immune to cold,
    or it could be granted by an item.  Immunity to a damage form is
    very unusual, but powerful mobs could theoretically be immune or
    they might be able to 'resist' many different types of damage or
    effects.  A mob might even be especially 'susceptible' to damage
    of a particular type, such as fire to a frost giant.  If a mob
    is immune to a particular type of damage or effect it can not be
    harmed or affected at all by that type.  So if a mob is immune
    to charm effects, the spell 'charm monster' will have no effect
    at all on the mob.  The different damage and effects are:

    Physical Damage:
        Blunt
        Pierce
        Slash
        Non-Magical Weapons
        +1 Weapons
        +2 Weapons
        +3 Weapons
        +4 Weapons

    Energy Damage:
        Acid
        Cold
        Drain
        Energy
        Fire
        Poison

    Special Effects:
        Charm
        Hold
        Sleep

#
"TERM IMP"

    This term refers to the highest level of immortals found on the mud,
    called 'implementor'.  These gods wield the most power and have a
    great deal of control and influence on what happens to the mud.  They
    are the highest authority and are typically the final judges on any
    issues concerning the mud.  Now for all these benefits, the
    implementors are also the people who spend the most time and effort
    in running and maintaining the mud, so that the players can enjoy
    it.  Most of their time is spent in administrating the myriad of
    problems and issues that crop up daily, from finding and fixing bugs,
    to soothing irate players, to making sure the server the mud is
    running on is working well.  While it is very easy to point fingers
    at the implementors when things don't seem to be going well, remember
    that they have a thankless job, and deserve your understanding and
    patience.  Complaining to, or yelling at, an implementor is a quick
    way to make them less inclined to continue to VOLUNTEER their time
    in running the mud.  Without implementors, there is no mud, so
    be civil and remember that implementors are people too.

#
"TERM IN CHARACTER"

    This term refers to the idea that everything communicated by a
    character should be in the voice of that character.  When speaking
    "in character" your character only says and knows things that the
    character would say or know, not what the player controlling the
    character would say or know.  This usually means at the very least
    that a character does not talk about things like their dogs, their
    apartments, and their computers.  If you really wish to talk
    about one of these things, there is a special communication
    channel dedicated to the purpose called 'ooc'.

#
"TERM INIT"

    This term refers to the fact that when nobody has visited a 'zone'
    in a while, it will be deactivated to save computer time.  When
    this happens, all mobs and objects are removed from the zone.  This
    is a shorted form of the word 'initialize'.  When a player re-enters
    the 'zone' the mud loads up all the mobs and objects in their default
    positions, thus repopulating the 'zone'.  When that happens, it
    is referred to as "initting" the zone.  You might ask someone,
    "Do you think that The Tower of High Death is init?".  It can also
    refer to whether objects and mobs have appeared as expected in a zone:
    "Is the Bottomless Bag initted?".

#
"TERM INITIALIZE"

    This term refers to the fact that when nobody has visited a 'zone'
    in a while, it will be deactivated to save computer time.  When
    this happens, all mobs and objects are removed from the zone.  When
    a player re-enters the 'zone' the mud loads up all the mobs and
    objects in their default positions, thus repopulating the 'zone'.
    When that happens, it is referred to as "initializing" the zone.  You
    might ask someone, "Do you think that The Tower of High Death is
    initialized?".  It can also refer to whether objects and mobs have
    appeared as expected in a zone: "Is the Bottomless Bag initialized?".

#
"TERM INT"

    This term refers to 'intelligence', the 'stat' that describes
    how smart and clever a creature is.  A high 'intelligence'
    will give you more mana, and you learn spells and skills more
    quickly.  A low intelligence would mean that you would have to
    spend a lot of practices to learn a new skill moderately well.
    The 'attribute' command gives information on all of your 'stats'.

#
"TERM INTELLIGENCE"

    This term refers to the 'stat' that describes how smart and

    more mana, and you learn spells and skills more quickly.
    A low intelligence would mean that you would have to
    spend a lot of practices to learn a new skill moderately well.
    The 'attribute' command gives information on all of your 'stats'.

#
"TERM LEGEND"

    This term refers to mortals who have spent a great deal of
    time and effort in reaching the peak of mortal power.  Only
    after earning more than 200 million experience can a person
    even be considered a legend.  Usually you think of legends
    as mortals who have chosen not to move on to the ranks of
    'immortality'.  Along with a title proclaiming Legend, a
    mortal achieving this rank also gets to see in depth
    detail regarding combat damage.

#
"TERM LINKDEAD"

    This term refers to the state of a character who has
    temporarily lost contact with the mud.  If your Internet
    connection drops, or your computer crashes, chances are
    your character is considered linkdead.  Linkdead means
    that your character remains immobile in the place where
    you lost your connection.  If attacked, they will flee
    automatically, seldom does going linkdead kill you.
    Eventually, if the connection is not re-established
    the character will be auto-rented.  The word "LINKDEAD"
    is appended to their title, so that anybody who sees
    them will know that the body is there, but the mind
    is elsewhere.

#
"TERM MANA REGEN"

    This term refers to the fact that at every mud hour,
    a certain amount of 'hitpoints', 'mana', and 'move' is
    regenerated in each creature.  The amount regenerated
    has several factors, and for 'mana', the total amount
    regenerated on a 'tick' is referred to as your mana regen.
    So if you have 45 'mana' before a 'tick', and after the
    'tick' you have 70 'mana', you would say that your mana
    regen is 25.  Mana regen is primarily a factor of
    your age, your wisdom, and your equipment.  You
    regen 'mana' fastest towards late middle age, and a
    high 'wisdom' can be a bonus.  Many items can help
    you to regain more 'mana' per 'tick', so if you find
    an object that says "MANA-REGEN By 5", you will
    regenerate 5 more 'mana' per 'tick' if you wear it.

#
"TERM MANA"

    This term refers to a concept, and the related quantifiable
    aspects of it.  Mana is quite simply the power source of
    magic.  In order to cast spells, you must have enough mana
    to power the spell.  So mana can be thought of magical energy
    that is gathered from the world around you.  Mana as a mudding
    term usually refers to the amount of magical energy you have.
    If you say, "I have 250 mana." you are telling people that is
    how much magical energy you can store total.  Many items may
    have bonuses or penalties to your total mana, so an identified
    item might say it has "MANA By 10", which means that if you
    wear it your maximum amount of mana you can store is increased
    by ten.

#
"TERM MAXXED"

    This term refers to an upper limit of experience that can be
    earned.  If you are currently at 10th level, you can not
    earn enough experience to advance past 11th level.  Eventually
    you will stop earning experience until you 'gain' and advance
    to 11th level, at which point you can earn more experience.
    If you have maxxed your experience for a level and then 'gain',
    you will be only 1 experience point away for the following
    level.  So if you have maxxed at 10th level and go to your
    guild and 'gain', you will be advanced to 11th level.  At
    that point you will be only 1 experience point away from
    being able to 'gain' and advance to level 12.  You might
    deliberately let yourself become maxxed on experience during
    an 'exp run' so that you don't have to stop during the
    middle of the run.

#
"TERM MYSTICAL"

    This term refers to a high level mortal, who is steadily climbing to
    the peak of mortal power, where each new level gained is not such
    a great change, but is a step closer to becoming as powerful as
    possible.  There are a group of distinctions that can help to narrow
    down how powerful an adventurer is.

    Apprentice
    Pilgrim
    Explorer
    Adventurer
    Mystical
    Hero

#
"TERM MOB"

    This term is a shortened version of the word 'mobile'.  It is a
    generic word to describe basically anything that is not an object
    or a room.  An adventurer is considered a 'mobile', and so is the
    orc that he or she fights and kills.  Technically anything that is
    a creature is considered a mobile, there is no distinction in this
    word between 'PC's and 'NPC's.  In common usage a 'mobile' refers
    to a NPC monster of any type, from a guildmaster to a red dragon.

#
"TERM MOBILE"

    This term is a generic word to describe basically anything that is

    and so is the orc that he or she fights and kills.  Technically anything
    that is a creature is considered a mobile, there is no distinction in
    this word between 'PC's and 'NPC's.  In common usage a 'mobile' refers
    to a NPC monster of any type, from a guildmaster to a red dragon.

#
"TERM MOVE REGEN"

    This term refers to the fact that at every mud hour,
    a certain amount of 'hitpoints', 'mana', and 'move' is
    regenerated in each creature.  The amount regenerated
    has several factors, and for 'move', the total amount
    regenerated on a 'tick' is referred to as your move regen.
    So if you have 45 'move' before a 'tick', and after the
    tick you have 70 'move', you would say that your move
    regen is 25.  Move regen is primarily a factor of
    your age, your race, and your equipment.  You
    regen 'move' fastest towards early middle age, and some
    races have a bonus.  Many items can help you to regain more
    'move' per 'tick', so if you find an object that says
    "MOVE-REGEN By 5", you will regenerate 5 more 'move' per
    'tick' if you wear it.

#
"TERM MOVE"

    This term refers to the amount of vitality you possess to
    move and fight.  Move is the mud's way of keeping track
    of how tired you are.  Every step you take drains some
    of your move, and every swing you take in combat drains
    some more.  The more move you have, the farther you can
    walk before resting and the more you can fight before
    getting too tired to swing your weapon.  So if you say
    "I have 120 move." you are expressing that your maximum
    amount of vitality is 120.  An item you find might say
    that is affects "MOVE By 10" in which case wearing that
    item will increase your maximum amount of move by 10.

#
"TERM MR"

    This term is shorthand for the term 'mana regen',
    which refers to the fact that at every mud hour,
    a certain amount of 'hitpoints', 'mana', and 'move' is
    regenerated in each creature.  The amount regenerated
    has several factors, and for 'mana', the total amount
    regenerated on a 'tick' is referred to as your mana regen.
    So if you have 45 'mana' before a 'tick', and after the
    'tick' you have 70 'mana', you would say that your mana
    regen is 25.  Mana regen is primarily a factor of
    your age, your wisdom, and your equipment.  You
    regen 'mana' fastest towards late middle age, and a
    high 'wisdom' can be a bonus.  Many items can help
    you to regain more 'mana' per 'tick', so if you find
    an object that says "MANA-REGEN By 5", you will
    regenerate 5 more 'mana' per 'tick' if you wear it.

#
"TERM MULTIPLAYING"

    This term refers to the illegal act of playing two characters
    at the same time.  Most muds enforce a strict policy of one
    character per player at a time.  If you want to play a
    different character, you should rent out your current
    character before bringing on your other one.  Failure to
    do so can be construed as multiplaying.  If you wish to
    give some equipment to another character of yours, you
    should drop it in a room, or give it to a trusted friend
    to give to your other character and rent out.  Do not bring
    on your other character and physically give the equipment to
    him or her.  While there are ways to disguise multiplaying,
    a curious immortal can almost always discover it eventually.
    If you mud with a friend who is physically near you (say
    in the same computer lab) and thus is easy to communicate
    with verbally, it is still recommended that you use mud
    channels to do most of your communication.  This will go a
    long way to avoiding any resemblance of multiplaying between
    you two.

#
"TERM NEWBIE"

    This term refers to a new player of a mud.  A person who is just
    learning how to mud is considered a newbie while they gain the
    knowledge needed to mud proficiently.  It is not a derogative
    term, but it is descriptive.  If more experienced players are
    aware that you are a newbie, they will usually go out of their
    way to help you, all you have to do is admit to being a newbie.
    Everybody was a newbie at some point in time, there is no
    shame attached to it, and if somebody does attempt to bring
    some negative connotation to it, they are being jerks and should
    be ignored and reported to the immortals.  There is a good deal
    of help directed towards new players, so feel free to avail
    yourself of that, even experienced mudders can usually find a tip
    or two in the newbie documentation, a place to start is
    "help newbie list".

#
"TERM NPC"

    This term refers to the difference between player controlled
    characters and creatures controlled by the mud system.  In a
    pen and paper role playing game a NPC would be controlled by
    the game master or dungeon master.  NPC stands for non-player
    character, and a player character would be called a 'PC'.

#
"TERM NUKE"

    This term refers to one of the worst punishments that can be
    meted out by an 'implementor'.  This basically results in
    a complete and utter destruction of a character.  This act
    is reserved for only the worst offenses, such as deliberate
    bug exploitation or extremely destructive behavior to the
    culture of the mud.  Verbally assaulting the implementors
    of the mud in a public forum with what is perceived as
    without cause by them is a good way to risk this punishment.
    The only conceivably worse punishment than this is called
    'banning' which is when all of a player's characters are
    banned from logging into the mud.

#
"TERM OOC"

    This term is an abbreviation for the term 'Out Of Character'.  This
    is the opposite of 'in character'.  Out of character means that
    the player is acknowledging that they are communicating information
    that their character does not possess.  This can be anything from
    what they are watching on TV to the fact that their dog has to be
    let out.  There is a public channel called 'ooc' that is available
    for discussions of this type.  If a player is speaking to another
    player, they might let that player know by prefacing their statement
    with the abbreviation "ooc".  Such as "You tell Joe 'ooc I'm watching
    the Simpsons right now, it's the episode where Maggie shoots
    Mr. Burns.'"

#
"TERM OUT OF CHARACTER"

    This term is the opposite of 'in character'.  Out of character means

    statement with the abbreviation "ooc".
    Such as "You tell Joe 'ooc I'm watching the Simpsons right now,
    it's the episode where Maggie shoots Mr. Burns.'"

#
"TERM PC"

    This term is an abbreviation of "player character".  This is the
    opposite of the term 'NPC', which stands for "non-player character".
    Essentially this refers to any player controlled character on the
    mud, so all the adventurers and immortals are PCs.  Any mud
    controlled creature is an 'NPC'.

#
"TERM PILGRIM"

    This term refers to a low level mortal, who is still struggling to
    understand the larger world around them.  There are a group of
    distinctions that can help to narrow down how powerful an adventurer
    is.

    Apprentice
    Pilgrim
    Explorer
    Adventurer
    Mystical
    Hero

#
"TERM PK"

    This term is an abbreviation for the term 'player kill'.  This refers
    to the ability of one character or 'PC' to kill another 'PC'.  The
    term can be applied to several levels of the concept of one player
    killing or causing harm to another player.  For a mud that does not
    allow any form of player killing, there is no way to harm another
    player directly (by casting spells or attacking).  Also indirect
    killing of a player is usually interpreted as illegal, such as
    summoning a player to a very dangerous area.  There might be
    limited player killing allowed on a mud, such as players can
    volunteer to be able to kill and be killed by other players.  Or
    there might be special areas where players are allowed to kill one
    another.  Finally there is what is usually referred to as unlimited
    player killing, where players can be killed at any time, shape or
    fashion.  Currently this mud implements a limited from of player
    killing, where it is limited to only a special area called the
    "Arena" which is not accessible unless the gods declare it is
    open, and no loss of experience or looting of equipment is allowed.
    Usually this is used by an 'immortal' for dueling purposes or as
    a quest of some type.

#
"TERM PKILL"

    This refers to the ability of one character or 'PC' to kill another 'PC'.

#
"TERM POWERMUDDER"

    This term refers to a particular type of player and playing style.
    It is a competitive form of mudding where maximizing of 'stats' is
    the primary goal, essentially the pursuit of power.  These are
    the type of players who are interested in having the best possible
    character, regardless of cost or role playing considerations.  This
    is the type of person who is always searching for the smallest
    little improvement to his or her characters.  If the player has
    a half-giant barbarian character, who measures 400 cm (13.1 feet)
    tall and up to 900 pounds in weight, he or she would think nothing
    of having that character wield a weapon called "a tiny pink dagger"
    if it provided them with a better overall 'stats' than their current
    "a huge two-handed sword".  This person does not have any 'role playing'
    concerns, and is far more likely to take advantage of a bug, rather
    than report it.  This is also the person most likely to vocally
    disapprove of any change that could potentially reduce overall
    character power.  Balance between 'PC's and 'NPC's is not generally
    a concern for this player, having the biggest and best character
    on the entire mud is generally the goal.

#
"TERM POWERMUDDING"

    This term refers to a type of playing style used by mudders.  It
    is a competitive form of mudding where maximizing of 'stats' is
    the primary goal, essentially the pursuit of power.  These are
    the type of players who are interested in having the best possible
    character, regardless of cost or role playing considerations.  This
    is the type of person who is always searching for the smallest
    little improvement to his or her characters.  If the player has
    a 'half-giant' 'barbarian' character, who measures 400 cm (13.1 feet)
    tall and up to 900 pounds in weight, he or she would think nothing
    of having that character wield a weapon called "a tiny pink dagger"
    if it provided them with a better overall 'stats' than their current
    "a huge two-handed sword".  This person does not have any 'role playing'

    than report it.  This is also the person most likely to vocally

    a concern for this player, having the biggest and best character
    on the entire mud is generally the goal.

#
"TERM PRACTICES"

    This term refers to the number of practice points you have, which
    can be seen using the 'score' command or the 'practice' command
    at your 'guildmaster'.  So if somebody asks you "How many practices
    do you have?" they are asking about your current number of
    available practice points.

#
"TERM PROC"

    This term is a generic reference to the term 'special procedure'.  A
    'special procedure' is when a room, object, or 'mobile' has some
    difference in operation than the normal standard for that type
    of object.  For instance, typing 'balance' at anywhere but a
    bank room will not produce any results.  But the bank room has
    a 'special procedure' attached to it that means that when the
    command 'balance' is used, the character sees his or her current
    amount of gold stored at the bank.  'Special procedure' is something
    slightly extraordinary, a 'mage' 'NPC' who casts spells would not be
    considered to have a 'special procedure'.  A 'mage' that is close to
    death who runs over and pulls on a rope that sounds a gong that
    instantly brings 20 warriors into the room while the mage runs out
    the back door to recuperate so that he can hunt you down later at
    his leisure would be considered to have a 'special procedure'.

#
"TERM QUEST POINTS"

    This term refers to the random and 'immortal' quest rewards that
    are available.  If you are walking about the realms and come across
    a 'mobile' with a multicolored aura surrounding them, they are
    the current holders of a random quest token.  If you kill that
    'mobile' and quickly loot the corpse, you will own that quest token.
    In a few moments, the gods replace that quest token with a quest
    potion, and if you 'quaff' that potion, you will receive a permanent
    quest point.  'Quest points' can be spent on special and powerful
    effects and equipment.

#
"TERM QUEST"

    This term refers to a generic event, usually administered by an
    'immortal' in which players try to reach a specific goal.  The
    goal is determined by the 'immortal' running the quest, and can
    be anything.  Usually the 'immortal' will have you enter the
    quest by using the 'quest' command, at which point you will
    have access to the 'qchat' channel.  There is usually a prize
    granted to the winners of a quest, which is determined by the
    'immortal'.  It might be a special item, or effect, or it might
    be one or more 'quest points'.

#
"TERM RE-EQUIP"

    This term refers to the act of replacing recently lost equipment.
    If you suffered through a spell that destroyed some of your gear,
    or if you hit a 'death trap', you might spend the next few hours
    "re-equipping".

#
"TERM REIMB"

    This term is considered shorthand for the term 'reimbursement'.
    Reimbursement is an 'immortal' granted form of recovering
    'equipment' that is lost due to a bug in the mud code.  If
    you feel that you lost everything you owned due to a mistake
    made by the code of the mud, you can request that a high level
    'immortal' grant you a reimbursement.  There must be clear
    evidence of the mud error, as well as a description of what
    the circumstances were when you lost your gear.  Here are the
    steps you need to take to be successfully reimbursed, failure
    to follow these steps will make a reimburse impossible:

    First:  DO NOT RENT OUT!  DO NOT RENT OUT!  DO NOT RENT OUT!
            If you have not been reimbursed by the time you need
            to leave the mud use the 'quit' command.  Renting out
            will make reimbursement impossible, so do not bother
            to start to 're-equip' if you believe you deserve a
            reimbursement.

    Second: Take note of exactly what the circumstances were when
            you lost the equipment.  Where you were, what command
            you typed last, why you think it was a problem with the
            mud.

    Third:  Find a high level 'immortal' to discuss the reimbursement
            request with.

    Fourth: If the 'immortal' denies your reimbursement request, do
            not take it personally.  Usually if you present a clear
            and concise summary of what happened, a reimbursement
            will be granted.  However, if you can not present a
            compelling case for reimbursement, then for the protection
            of mud balance, an 'immortal' may not grant you the
            reimbursement.  Otherwise, anytime somebody died you
            would have the newly killed person attempt to trick an
            'immortal' into granting them a reimbursement rather than
            having to go back and get their gear off of their corpse.
            Also failure to follow the first step of reimbursement
            (the "DO NOT RENT OUT!" step) will make a reimbursement
            impossible regardless.

#
"TERM REINC"

    This term is an abbreviation of the term 'reincarnation'.
    Reincarnation is a druidic spell of great power.  With it
    a dead adventurer can be brought back to life.  However the
    spell brings the spirit of the adventurer back into a
    different body, which could be a different race than the
    original race of the adventurer.  So when someone speaks
    of "wanting a reinc" they are talking about having this
    spell used to bring them back as a different race.  Some
    races have advantages over other races, but it is a risky
    proposition, you might come back as a fire giant, or you
    might come back as a goblin.  See the 'reincarnation' spell
    for the details.

"TERM REINCARNATION"

    might come back as a goblin.  See the 'reincarnation' spell
    for the details.

#
"TERM REPOP"

    This term refers to the fact that a 'zone' will 'initialize'
    periodically.  When a 'zone' initializes it resets back to
    it's default setup, including 'mob's, objects and rooms.
    While repop can refer to any time this happens, it is
    most often used to refer to when the zone initializes while
    players are still in the zone, so that creatures and objects
    reappear suddenly.  It can be slightly dangerous if you are
    in a room where a very mean nasty mob suddenly appears.
    Sometimes it is a godsend, especially on an 'exp run'.

#
"TERM RESIST"

    This term refers to the idea that a creature can be somewhat
    unaffected by certain damage types or effects.  This could be
    naturally occurring, such as a frost giant being resistant to cold,
    or it could be granted by an item.  Resistance to a damage form isn't
    that unusual, for instance a skeleton will be resistant to piercing
    attacks.  Powerful mobs could theoretically be 'immune' or
    resistant to many different types of damage or effects.  A mob might
    even be especially 'susceptible' to damage of a particular type, such
    as fire to a frost giant.  If a mob is resistant to a particular type of
    damage or effect it will suffer only half damage, or get two chances
    instead of the normal one chance to avoid being affected by that type.
    So if a mob is resistant to charm effects, the spell 'charm monster'
    will have a much lower chance of working on the mob, but it will still
    have a chance to succeed.  The different damage and effects are:

    Physical Damage:
        Blunt
        Pierce
        Slash
        Non-Magical Weapons
        +1 Weapons
        +2 Weapons
        +3 Weapons
        +4 Weapons

    Energy Damage:
        Acid
        Cold
        Drain
        Energy
        Fire
        Poison

    Special Effects:
        Charm
        Hold
        Sleep

#
"TERM RESURRECTION"

    This term refers to the spell 'resurrection' and the desire for
    one.  If someone asks for a 'resurrection' they are asking for
    a cleric to cast this spell on a recently deceased corpse.
    "Can Rathgar get a resurrection?

#
"TERM REZ"

    This term is shorthand for the term 'resurrection' which refers
    to the spell 'resurrection' and the desire for one.  If someone
    asks for a 'resurrection' they are asking for a cleric to cast
    this spell on a recently deceased corpse. "Can Rathgar get a
    resurrection?"

#
"TERM ROLEPLAYING"

    This term refers to the act of creating a whole separate
    personality for a character.  Typically a player would
    consider him or herself a roleplayer, meaning that they
    always attempt to stay 'in character', speaking as their
    character.  Breaks into 'out of character' actions and
    communications are rare, and usually prefaced by an 'ooc'
    disclaimer.  The nice thing about role playing is that it
    is contagious, when one person does it, other people tend
    to follow the lead and roleplay as well.

#
"TERM RP"

    This term is an abbreviation of the term 'role playing',
    which refers to the act of creating a whole separate

#
"TERM SANC"

    This term is an abbreviation for the 'sanctuary' spell.
    People use this to describe the desire for the spell, or
    in regards to the current status of the spell.  For instance:
    "Hey, I need a sanc", or "The sanc is dropping in a tick".

#
"TERM SCRAPPED"

    This term describes the past tense verb of when things get
    destroyed and become scraps.  So you might say: "I got
    hit by a disintegrate spell and everything scrapped."

#
"TERM SPEC PROC"

    This term is an abbreviation for the term 'special procedure which
    is when a room, object, or 'mobile' has some difference in
    operation than the normal standard for that type of object.
    For instance, typing 'balance' at anywhere but a bank room
    will not produce any results.  But the bank room has a
    'special procedure' attached to it that means that when the
    command 'balance' is used, the character sees his or her current

#
"TERM STAT"

    This term is a generic reference to the quantifiable aspects of
    a character, object, spell, or skill.  It can refer to the
    physical attributes of a character, like 'strength' or 'charisma'.
    It can refer to the information about an object, like how much
    damage it does, and what effects it has.  Some examples are:
    "What are your stats?" "My strength is 17, my dexterity is 12...".
    "What are the stats of that long sword?" "It does 1d7 damage and
    is +5 to hit and +5 to damage."

    damage it does, and what effects it has.  Some examples are:
    "What are your stats?" "My strength is 17, my dexterity is 12...".
    "What are the stats of that long sword?" "It does 1d7 damage and
    is +5 to hit and +5 to damage."

#
"TERM STR"

    This term is an abbreviation of the term 'strength'.  Strength
    is a physical attribute of a creature, which indicates their
    overall muscle power.  A high strength means you can carry
    a lot of gear and do more damage you hit a target in combat.
    Low strength means that you might not be able to wield a large
    weapon with only one hand.  The 'attribute' command gives you
    information on your physical characteristics.

#
"TERM SUSCEPTIBLE"

    This term refers to the idea that a creature can be very
    vulnerable to certain damage types or effects.  This could be
    naturally occurring, such as a frost giant being susceptible to fire,
    or it could be granted by an item.  Susceptibility to a damage form is
    somewhat unusual, but it could be an Achilles heel useable against
    powerful mobs who might be immune or resistant to many different types
    of damage or effects.  If a mob is susceptible to a particular type of
    damage or effect it will take double damage from that type and be much
    more likely to be affected by that type.  So if a mob is susceptible
    to charm effects, the spell 'charm monster' will have a much greater
    chance of affecting the mob.  The different damage and effects are:

    Physical Damage:
        Blunt
        Pierce
        Slash
        Non-Magical Weapons
        +1 Weapons
        +2 Weapons
        +3 Weapons
        +4 Weapons

    Energy Damage:
        Acid
        Cold
        Drain
        Energy
        Fire
        Poison

    Special Effects:
        Charm
        Hold
        Sleep

#
"TERM TICK"

    This term refers to the fact that the game time on a mud is divided
    up into hours.  Each hour of the mud is a slightly random interval
    of time, usually between 60 and 80 seconds.  When the hour is
    updated to the next hour it is called a tick.  When a tick occurs,
    many things are updated on the mud.  Every creature regains some
    of their lost 'hitpoints', 'mana', and 'move'.  And all effects
    that have a time limit, such as spells or skills like 'armor',
    'sanctuary', 'mind over body', 'spy' or 'quivering palm' decrement
    their time remaining before the spell falls, or the skill is
    usable again.  "The sanctuary spell is falling next tick."

#
"TERM UNDERWATER"

    This term refers to the fact that you can have adventures
    underwater in some areas.  You must be able to breathe
    water to do so though, most commonly through the use of
    the 'water breath' spell.  While underwater no verbal
    communication is possible, not even 'gtell' or 'emote'.
    You can use 'sign language' underwater, but obviously
    that is limited to only people in the room with you who
    understand 'sign language'.  It is not possible to cast
    spells underwater, as they require some verbal utterance.

#
"TERM WB"

    This term in an abbreviation that refers to the spell 'water breath'.
    If someone is asking: "Are you wb?" they are asking whether you
    can breathe water, or whether you need the spell cast on you.

#
"TERM WIS"

    This term is an abbreviation of the term 'wisdom'.  Wisdom
    is a physical attribute of a character which indicates their
    general level of self-possession and understanding of the
    importance of things.  It is the other half of a person's
    mental attributes from 'intelligence'.  The difference
    between 'intelligence' and wisdom is illustrated by this
    example.  A person with a high intelligence comes to a
    rickety bridge.  He observes it carefully, checks it's
    underlying structure, determines it will probably be
    able to hold his weight and decides to cross.  Another
    person with a high wisdom comes to the same bridge.  She
    looks at it long enough to determine that it is definitely
    rickety.  Then she starts to look at her overall situation
    and attempts to determine whether it is even necessary to
    cross the bridge at all, or whether her goals can be
    accomplished with dealing with the bridge at all.  In game
    terms a high wisdom means that you receive more 'practices'
    per level than a person with a low wisdom and you will
    regenerate more 'mana' per 'tick'.  The 'attribute' command
    will give you information about your physical 'stats'.

"TERM WISDOM"

    This term refers to the physical attribute of a character
    which indicates their general level of self-possession
    and understanding of the importance of things.  It is

    'intelligence'.  The difference between 'intelligence'

    and attempts to determine whether it is even necessary to
    cross the bridge at all, or whether her goals can be
    accomplished with dealing with the bridge at all.  In game
    terms a high wisdom means that you receive more 'practices'
    per level than a person with a low wisdom and you will
    regenerate more 'mana' per 'tick'.  The 'attribute' command
    will give you information about your physical 'stats'.

#
"TERM ZONE"

    This term refers to a specific set of rooms, which are
    grouped together to make an area that follows a theme.
    Some zones are sprawling, containing several hundred
    rooms.  Others are 20 rooms, designed to just represent
    a small, specific section of the world.  You can tell
    what zone you are in by using the 'whozone' command.
    The boundaries between zones make a large difference
    in how the mud interprets locations.  For instance,
    you could be 100 rooms away from another player
    in the same zone and be able to tell where he or
    she is using either the 'whozone' command or the
    'where' command.  However, a person could be only
    one room over, but in a different zone and neither
    command will be able to find that person.

"UTIL ALIAS"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  alias [<0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9> <command>]
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping

    This command is very useful in providing a shortcut to commonly typed out
    commands.  Without an argument the 'alias' command will print out your
    current aliases.  The aliases are commands that use the numbers 0 through
    9 as shortcuts.  Typing "1" will result in the command stored in the
    "1" alias to be sent to the mud.  So if you find yourself typing: kill
    orc a lot, you can alias it to 1, so that anytime you see an orc you just
    have to type "1", instead of "kill orc".  Any valid mud command can be
    aliased in this manner by including a single digit and then a command
    after the 'alias' command.  See the usage of these aliases by looking at
    "help UTIL 0" or "help UTIL 9".  Be careful about assigning an alias to
    "1" because if you should happen to die and have pre-typed "1", the menu
    you see after you die uses "1" as the option of entering the game at
    the inn you last rented at.  You might find yourself returning back
    to the game from the menu before you were ready to come back.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You want to set the alias 0 to cast the spell 'word of recall'.

    mud.  This should be used for functionality bugs, not for a 'typo' or
    a new 'idea'.  A short description of the bug and the situation it
    occurred in is helpful.  The command will automatically log your name
    and where you type the command, so if the bug involves a room, there
    is no need to name the room.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You tried out a newly implemented feature and it didn't work
    correctly as you understand it.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> bug I was fighting and I was still able to
    do the foobar command, but it doesn't seem like I should be able to foobar
    while fighting.
    Havok>  Ok.

"UTIL BUGMAIL"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  bugmail
    Positions   :  mounted, standing

    This command can be used if you have a long drawn out bug report.
    It will send a mudmail to the appropriate authorities, so you
    can explain the bug in detail.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You found a difficult to explain bug and want to report it.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> bugmail
    Havok>  The scribe tells you, 'I'll take 150 coins for the delivery.'
            The scribe tells you, 'Write your message, use /w when done.
            Use /? for more info on editing strings.'

"UTIL IDEA"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  idea <description>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping,
                   stunned, incapacitated, mortally wounded, dead

    This command is used to submit a quick new idea of how to make the mud
    better.  If you have a new type of skill that might be interesting, or
    a new spell, or even a twist on an existing command, this is the forum
    for that idea.  It will log your name and your current location, so if
    you will get credit for the idea, and if it's specific to the room or
    zone you are in, you don't need to specify the place.

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: You think that there is a real need and use for the foobar
    command.
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> idea How about a foobar command, which will
    let you both foo and bar in the same round.
    Havok>  Ok. Thanks.

"UTIL TYPO"
    Usable by   :  All 1
    Usage       :  typo <description>
    Positions   :  mounted, standing, fighting, sitting, resting, sleeping,
                   stunned, incapacitated, mortally wounded, dead

    This command is used to submit a typo, grammatical mistake, or just
    plain bad formatting to the authorities.  If you see a misspelled
    word, or a poorly formed sentence, or something which cosmetically
    doesn't look right, this is the forum to submit the problem.  Please
    use liberally, mudders are usually computer geeks who are long on
    imagination and short on composition skills.  This will log your
    name and location, so there is no need to specify what room you
    see the typo in.  A good format to show the typo and the correct
    replacement might be: typo compilcated -> complicated

    (Situation, what you type at the prompt, the message you should see):
    Situation: The room you are in has misspelled the word "village".
    H:50/50 M:120/120 V:100/100> typo villiage -> village
    Havok>  Ok. Thanks.
