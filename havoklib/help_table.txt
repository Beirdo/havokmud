AGING AGE

   Age is your starting age plus the number of game years that have passed
   since your character was created, regardless of how much of that time you
   spent rented, and how much playing.  To see the current game year use 'time'.
   The haste spell adds to your age (permanently) as does some  equipment
   (temporarily).  Age has several game effects.

   Start to middle age -
   move (vitality) regeneration, hitpoint regeneration rate increases.

   Middle age to old age -
   maximum hit points, move regen, and HP regen decrease.

   Ancient and older -
   Everything starts decreasing..

ALIAS

   alias -- no arguments - shows a list of your existing aliases.
   alias <num> command -- assigns the command to the number num, which has
                          to be between 0 and 9.
         <num> will execute this command.

   example:  > alias 1 kill    > 1 lamia

   You hit the lamia. Get the idea?  Only one command per alias.

#
ALIGNMENT

  The alignment a player follows is dependant of what kind of creatures
  he tends to kill. Killing good aligned mobiles will make you evil, killing
  evil aligned creatures will make you good, and killing a nice mix of those
  will keep you neutral. Paladins are required to stay good aligned, while
  druids cannot become good or evil. Rangers cannot become evil. Other classes
  don't have alignment issues, other than the fact some equipment might pop off.

ARENA

  Occasionally, the Gods will like to see a test of strength from mortals.
  By opening an Arena, players can test their prowess in battle against
  fellow players, without the risk of losing experience, equipment or money
  if they die. To see if the Arena is currently open, just type 'arena'.

"ARMOR CLASS"

   Armor Class is based on the AD&D idea that the lower ones AC is, the less
   often they get hit.  Armor classes range from "barely armored" to "armored
   like a dragon".  In numeric terms, this is a range from 100 to -100.  If you
   are acquainted with AD&D, a 100 corresponds to a 10 AC, and a -100 corresponds
   to a -10 AC.    Dexterity also affects how often you get hit, the higher your
   dexterity  (up to 18) the lower your natural AC (your AC without any armor or
   spells on).  For every point of dexterity above 15 (16+) your natural (100) AC
   is reduced by 10.  This does not apply to monks.  The highest AC that a person
   can have is -100.  The AC-apply works this way: The raw AC-apply is multiplied
   by a multiplier, and subtracted from total  armor class.

    Area        Body  Head  Legs  Feet  Hands  Arms  Shield Other
    Multiplier   *3    *2    *2    *1     *1    *1      *1   *0

   Example, wearing a AC-apply 5 breastplate(body) gives you -15 to AC.

ASSIST

   If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same person
   the <player> is.  ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player>
   continues fighting. It is better than KILL in many cases because you
   do not have to choose between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just
   entered the room). Even though monsters of the same type assist each
   other in combat, ASSIST is better because you will eliminate one
   aggressor much faster.

#
BREATH

    Usage : breath <Target Mob>
          : breath

   The breath command allows you to use a breath weapon on another monster.The only
   way to get a breath weapon is to either be a monster with such an ability (dragons
   usually have one) or quaff a potion of fire/ice/acid/gas/lightning breath. If you
   are already fighting, breath without any arguments will breath on the monster you
   are fighting.  If you are NOT fighting you must supply the name of a target to
   breath on.  Breath weapons are terrifying and most opponents will flee before
   you get a chance to breath on them.  However, you may blast bystanders with the
   same breath.  This means breath weapons are not terribly accurate.  You will
   always hit the monster you target and will usually hit his group, followers and
   his leader.  You will also probably blast anyone currently hitting on you.  You
   also have a small chance (less than half) of hitting each bystander (someone not
   covered above).  They will not appreciate this and will probably decide to beat
   the snot out of you.  When quaffed breath potions modify you so that you can
   breath ONE time.  If you do not breath in 2-3 rounds the potion will explode
   inside you causing half of its normal damage.  These potions also reduce your
   CON for the duration of the spell.  You therefore cannot quaff more breath weapon
   levels than you have constitution.  You also cannot quaff more breath weapon levels
   than you have levels.  The damage of a breath weapon is a function of its level,
   your level, and your hitpoints.  If your level is equal to the breath weapon's
   level it will do your hitpoints worth of damage to the target.  If your level is
   double the level of the breath weapon it will only do half your hitpoints of damage.
   Monsters natural breath weapons exceed the CON restriction and even a 50th level
   monster can do full damage.  Since most huge monsters have huge hitpoints, this can
   be a LOT of damage.  do not ever fight a titanium dragon.

BRIEF

    Usage  :brief

GROUP GROUPING

    Usage : GROUP [player]

   Some new changes to encourage grouping:
   1) leader of a group gets 5% exp bonus per kill per pc in group
   2) followers get 3% bonus (per pc)

   If you are a group member, then you will share experience points
   for killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points
   will only be shared among group members that are in the same
   location, at the time of the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of
   whether the group members have been participating in the fight.
   Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.
   To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
   must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader
   should NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group
   membership for each player in the group, by using
   "group <player_name>". The leader should remember to include himself
   in the group.

   Example :   Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.
   Quifael :   "follow dragon"
   Redferne: "follow dragon"
   Dragon  : "group dragon"
   Dragon  : "group redferne"
   Dragon  : "group quifael"

   kick Quifael out of the group. It is also possible to set
   your group name with the SET command.

GUILD

   The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles
   and perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded (HA!), so that
   only members may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where
   people come to learn and practice the skills of their trade.
   The Clerics guild is located west of the temple square.  The Mages guild
   is located just east of the west gate, south of the wizards shop. The
   Thieves guild is located in a dark alley.  The Warriors guild is located
   just west of the east gate, south from the weaponsmith's shop.  The Monk's
   guild is farther away, west and north from took hill in the shire.  The
   Druids guild is in the forest of Haon-daor, near a small cabin in the woods.
   (levels 9 and under).. The 10th+ level druid guild is inside the colossal tree.
   You MUST have the spell 'tree travelling' to get inside your guild, so be warned.
   You almost definitely need the spell 'Flame Blade' to win the competition
   required for each level. The Psionic's guild is located near Levee. The
   Barbarian's guild is located north of the east gate. The Paladins guild
   is located west of the temple square.

   Note..
   these are multi-room complexes..  once you enter the entrance, type
   exits, to see where the bar is, and you can get from the bar to the
   practice/guildmaster area.   Once at the guildmaster, you can practice
   spells and skills.

#
IMMORTALITY

   Some characters have left this mortal coil and become Immortals
   (sometimes referred to as god or wizards.)  You may REQUEST immortality
   after you earn 200,000,000 experience per class. Very rarely, someone
   will be given an immortal for some significant service to the mud.  We
   ask that when you request immortality, you do so with ALL your equipment
   still intact, to keep equipment circulating, and prove your commitment.
   Please do not get rid of anything that you normally used over the adept
   portion of your career, and give away NOTHING at all for the last 10 or
   so million experience. If you played a well equipped adept, we expect
   you to sacrifice a well equipped adept in order to become an immortal.
   Trying to weasel around this and find loopholes will show you are not suited
   to immortality, where you must obey strict rules, enforce the intent of rules,
   and consider the good of the mud before your own personal good.  Lesser Deities
   (level 51) are give limited power and must follow strict rule preventing them
   from helping (or harming) mortals.  They must not interfere with the normal
   running of the game. The are not allowed to use their immortal character to
   gain any information about the mud.  As immortals perform services to the MUD,
   such as writing zones, they may be advanced in level. The highest immortals,
   the true gods of the mud, are bound only by their own code of honor.
   The rules they set for lower gods express how they expect the mud to be run.
   Do not ask them to do thing lower gods are not allowed to do, as they may get
   irritated.

   **** THINK carefully before you ask to become an IMMORTAL! *****

   Many people find it VERY boring.  You can't group with friends, can't kill
   stuff, can't cast spells on mortals, and can't explore anything.  Even what
   you say to others becomes restricted, as you may have privileged information,
   and are considered to be representing the MUD when you speak to mortals.
   Unless you wish to write zones or do other work on the mud, immortality is
   rather pointless.

   dragons breath, doing lots of damage to people and equipment.
   non pc followers only get 1/2 the exp they would get if they weren't charmed.
    the other 1/2 is lost.
   Some monsters are too big to bash.. in general, dragons, most 'huge' things,
    purple worm, etc, are all non-bashable.
   sneak allows you to avoid aggressive monsters.
   monsters develop hatreds very quickly, and will try to hunt you down and kill
    you for hurting them.
   kangaroos hate all kinds of enfan.
   most mobs that should see in the dark do.
   some monsters are immune to the things you would expect them to be immune to.
   some monsters are also resistant to certain attacks and/or susceptible to
    others (resist = 1/2 damage, susc = 2* dam)
   monsters HELP each other out.  They don't sit by and watch.
   player characters are very powerful:  many spells, attacks, etc.
   monsters are weaker individually, most of the time.  However, the monsters here
    are not as stupid as they are on other muds, and they tend to be tougher, because
    of that, and because they help each other.
   rule of thumb:  Grouping is a good idea.
   it is easier to play mages and thieves if you are patient.
   You don't have to be as patient, if you are more willing to group.
   My goals for the classes:
      Fighters: powerful at lower levels, much less useful at higher levels.
      Clerics:  reasonably powerful and useful all along.
      Mages:    weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
      Thieves:  Good for scouting, very nice when grouped.
      Monks:    Weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
      Druids:   Medium at all levels, like clerics.
   spellcasting is harder to do in combat.
   generally, the more powerful the spell, the harder to cast in combat.
   magic missile, acid blast, shocking grasp, cause light, serious,
    critical, are all fairly easy to cast in combat.
   While your equipment can be damaged by spells and such, there are some things
    you can do minimize the damage.
     #1, if you are fighting something that does fire damage,
     being immune or resistant to fire yourself will help your
     equipment out as well.
   Good saves will also in general reduce the amount of damage.

LEVELS

   Lists the levels of your class.

#
LINK

   A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
   very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
   out a solution. There are two cases:

   I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each time
      someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you will be saved
      by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you reconnect to the game.

   II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we can give,
      is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By  breaking the link you
      can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

#
 LIST

   In a shop this command will list what the shopkeeper has for sale, with prices.

#
LOAD NOTCH

          : Load <item>

   The command parameters are 'notch <item>'. You will then attempt to notch/load
   the item into the weapon you currently wield. You can also use 'load <item>',
   it will have the SAME results. This is how you can notch a arrow to be FIRE at

#
MONK

   Monks are a sub-class of fighters which are very quick and agile. They use
   various attack forms taught by Cain the monk guildmaster at the monk  monastry.
   Monks concentrate on becoming harmonious not only with themselves, but with
   nature, giving them some advantages in fighting and, over time,  skills which
   reflect this harmony.  Furthermore, at very high levels, monks develop natural
   resistances to certain sources of damage.  Monks don't generally use weapons or
   shields, for they hit harder with there bare hands.  At high levels monks have
   been known to get up to 5 regular attacks,

See also:  MONK DAMAGE, MONK ATTACKS

#
"MONK ATTACKS"

   The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk will get per
   round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide the
   probability of getting an extra attack each round. (i.e. if you were VERY
   lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but probably won't)

[a few samples: Level--#Att]

 1--1.00    5--1.25
 9--1.50   13--1.75
17--2.00   21--2.25
25--2.50   29--2.75

MOUNT RIDE RIDING

    Usage : Mount <Mount name>

   It is now possible to mount horses and dragons.. Certain aspects
   are not finalized, so it is not advisable to mount aggressive dragons.
   Currently there are no horses of the correct race to be ridden, so, for
   the moment, it is only possible to ride dragons.  However, dragons are
   not docile creatures, and it will take a large amount of riding skill,
   and a high level character to do it with any amount of ability.  You
   can order your mount to do things, as if he/she was a follower, but
   he/she isn't, so you can't group with the mount.  Each time you attack
   something, or your mount attacks something, or each time you take damage
   or your mount takes damage, you have a chance of being thrown from the back
   of your mount. It is easier for evil chars to ride evil dragons, and
   good chars to ride good dragons. To get an idea of how powerful one has
   to be to ride dragons,  a 60th level character can typically only successfully
   ride on Yevaud if said character has a -1000 alignment, or is affected by the
   dragon-riding spell.  Or if yevaud is heavily damaged.

#
MULTIPLAYING

  We can be short on this: Multiplaying is *not* allowed. Going linkdead
  with one player and logging on with another is also not allowed. If one
  is caught multiplaying, a warning is issued, and if one's caught doing
  it again, the player will get zapped (nuked, erased, you get the drift).

#
NEWBIE

   These are a few things that should help you get past your first few levels.
   Most important:

   -You start off in the Temple of Karsinya. To the east is a
    room that generally has free equipment in it. To the west
    is a zone designed for level 1 characters. The copper equipment
    is pretty good starting gear.

   -From the Temple of Karsinya, Meeting Square is s 2e 4n.
    This is a central location for the town. East is the inn, and west is the
    guildhall.

   -People of the same race will assist each other in battles.
    This means that attacking a creature when others of its kind are around
    is not very wise unless you can take them all on.

   -Be PATIENT, levels do not necessarily come overnight.  Fast gains are usually
    risky and lead to death too often.

   -If in doubt about something, ask someone.

    Others:

   -Cityguards and Royal Guards do jump into battles.  They will jump in on
    the side of the person with the higher alignment.

   -Player killing is not allowed.

   -Some skills you only need to invest one practice into, and then you can improve
    them with use.  This especially applies to Monks and Thieves.

    Mages:

   -Learn Magic Missile, it helps.

    Clerics:

   -Avoid getting lower level version of spells if you think that you can get
    to a high enough level to use a more powerful version. For example practice
    cure serious instead of cure light if you can get by without cure light.

    Druids:

   -Learn Tree Travel at 10th, or else you won't be able to advance past that.

   -Learn Flame Blade, or else getting past 10th will be a real pain.

   If you have any comments about things you think you should see here,
   post them on the board, and we will see what we can do about adding them.

    Usage : practice <skill or spell>
          : practice -<class initial>

   Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go to your
   guildmaster to let him/her help you improve (GAIN).  If you type practice,
   you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good you already are
   at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to practice the appropriate skill.
   You can only practice a certain amount for each level you gain, and you do not
   have to use this, it can be accumulated.

#
PRAY

    Usage : Pray <God Name> <Worship/wish/pray>

   This is a simple way for mortals to contact their deity in hopes or receiving a
   response or help. Although it could be a way to just simply worship :). The chance
   of your prayer getting answered is based on your level of experience, you will
   receive a bonus to this chance if you are of the cloth (cleric). To pray simply
   type 'pray DIETYNAME, would thine be kind enough to grant me a loaf of bread?'.
   Remember that you need to keep the prayers short and to the point. Long prayers
   will get ignore most likely, and people asking for EQ/EXP or the like will be
   ignore no matter what.  Mortals may wish for single spelled potions, scrolls and
   food/water.

   Example : Pray Banon, Could you please grant me a purple potion oh great one.

  Quest. Participation of quests is optional. The immortal may set a minimum
  level the players have to be to participate to protect the lower levels from
  the dangers a quest might entail. There are prizes to be won. These can range
  from a pat on the back, to a potion of choice, to a restring, to a quest point,
  and in some extraordinary cases, to a quest item.  Rules and prizes for the quest
  are set by the immortal running it, and cannot be bartered about.  You can tell

  is not entirely bug free. If the Gods so decide, player is entitled to a

RULES
                                  ******* MORTAL RULES *******
This is a list of rules for all players of Havok.  You are expected to know these rules
well and follow them all the time.  Also check these rooms now  and then for any additions
or changes to the rules.

1) If you have a problem or a question please read the help files, news, and ask
   other mortals first before asking an immortal.  Most questions we get can be
   answered by another mortal.

2) Player killing is illegal.  This includes such things as summoning a PC to the
   purple worm to get them killed. There is never an excuse to kill someone, if you
   feel a problem has reached that extend tell an immortal about it, never  take
   a problem into your own hands. The only exception to this are immortal sponsored
   Arenas, which are apart from the mud itself.

3) Stealing from another player is illegal.  Even if you know the person and they are
   sitting right next to you in real life, it's still illegal.  If you must practice
   stealing go to a low level mob and practice.

4) Kill stealing is illegal.  If you walk into a room that has a person and a mob in it,
   ask that person first if this is their mob.  If a mob looks out of place, like the
   beholder out of the temple of Old Thalos, do a whozone and see if the mob is being
   attacked by someone else before you attack it. However, there is no mob "reserving".
   If you are planning on killing a mob you must do so within two minutes, you cannot
   just sit there reserving a mob for your group for 15 minutes.

5) Casting harmful spells on other PC's is illegal.  This includes things like faerie
   fire, hypnosis, or feeblemind.  Also using charmed mobs to attack other PC's is illegal.
   Such acts are very childish and not becoming of a good mudder.

6) Looting players corpses is illegal.  If you must get stuff from the corpse of the
   person make SURE you have the permission of that person first.  Then, and only then,
   can you get the stuff.

7)  No foul language will be tolerated over public channels.  This includes words using
    symbols to represent certain letters in the word. If you cannot control yourself,
    your ability to use public channels will be disabled.

8)  Do not whine.  This includes whining to higher levels about grouping with them, etc.
    Any problems should be discussed maturely with your fellow players.  Whining just
    aggravates others to the point of refusing to give a character any help whatsoever.

9)  Lag is a part of every MUD.  We understand that it can be frustrating, but in general,
    there is nothing we can do about it.  Whining about it only annoys everyone.  If you
    feel that there is a need for a wclean, feel free to ask for one in a polite and
    mature manner.

10)  In general, multi-playing is illegal.  Multi-playing is the act of having more than
     one character logged on at one time.  The reasonning behind the lack of multi-playing
     allowed is that multi-playing is the easiest way to cheat, and help one's self out.
     Players must rent out, prior to bringing out another charector.

11)  Above all, use common sense.  Don't act childish and you won't be treated
     like a child.  Any problems should be reported to an implementor. All comments
     will be kept confidential unless otherwise requested.

12)  Do not share characters.  Your password is the key to safety.  It does not
     matter what the name of your character is, do not give your password  to
     anyone, enabling them to use your character, because the implementors are
     not responsible for any damage done to your character in your absence,
     and reimbursements will not be given.

13)  Player bots are illegal. Bots are programs that perform tasks independent
     of player input. Havok is for players, not robots. If you really feel like
     programming, become an immortal, we can put the effort to better use. It
     is a fine line between the various aids that are standard in most Mud clients,
     like triggers and autopaths, and an automated bot. Certainly you will have to
     attend the keyboard while you mud. Thus if an immortal asks for you while you
     are obviously active, it would be wise for you to answer. And as a final note,
     Seth and  Newbieguide are -not- player bots, they are immortal sponsored, and
     are  not subject to this rule.

14) Do not reveal an immortal that is invisible, even if he/she has made her presence
    known to you.  There are reasons that immortals have the ability to be unseen.

#
RUN

    Usage:  Run <Direction>

   To RUN simply type 'run <dir>' where <dir> is the direction you wish to
   run (north,south,east,west,up,down). You will then be 'hurried' through
   the rooms/locations until you get to a room that does not have a exit in
   the direction you are running. In other words if you 'run west' you will
   run westwards until you get to a room without an exit west. Run requires
   more movement points and you must have a minimum movement.   WARNING: You
   CAN hit DT's this way!

See also:  DT

#
SAVE

    Usage : save

   Save your persona. This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
   It also saves your equipment, up to the first 200 items.  Note that you
   cannot go back to a save point, this only allows the mud to recover your
   file should in the case of a crash.  You are automatically saved every
   time you rent.

Also see : INN, QUIT

#
SAY TELL WHISPER SHOUT ASK GOSSIP REPLY

     Usage : say <text to be said>
           : tell <PC> <text to be said>
           : whisper <PC> <text to be said>
           : shout <text to be said>
           : ask <PC> <text to be said>
           : ' <text to be said>
   If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
   better if you start your sentences with either say,tell,whisper or shout.
   When using SAY you speak in a language that you choose, via SPEAK. If the
   PC's do not understand you will not be able to communicate. All other commands
   (tell,gos,shout,whisper) do not use a special language.  The scope of these
   methods of comunications is as follows:

       say ------> to everyone in your current room.
       tell------> Zone communication to target.
       whisper---> to target in your current room.
       shout-----> to entire mud.
       ask-------> to target in your current room.
       reply-----> to the last person that told you something.
       gossip----> to all in your current zone.
       ooc-------> to entire mud (out of character)

 Special notes:
   -'shout' is very physically exhausting and will take up
    a bit of your mana and movement.
   -'tell' will work anywhere in the mud if you are talking
    to an immortal.
   -'reply' is good for speaking with invisible persons who
    talked to you first.
   - no harrasing of players or in anyway abuse any of these
    channels of communication.
   -'ooc' is the channel to use if you are chatting about things
    that do not pertain to the game

SETH BOT

   Seth is havok's official helper bot.  He will cast spells and summon you to town
   if your in need of help.  Be aware that that he does get tired and will rent out
   if you tire him out too much. If you don't know how to use Seth, then just go up
   to him  and 'tell seth help' which should get you started.    People made bots
   are illegal..  See the hall of rules for further details on that issue.

Also see : HELP RULES

#
"SHOOT"

See FIRE,NOTCH,LOAD

#
SHOPS

   Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
   and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
   with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
   merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
   of high quality!   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory
   of a shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers
   are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of trading and, indeed,
   surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.
   (They usually have a few thousand hitpoints and can shoot through schools).

          : disarm <trap name>
    Level : 1 Paladin, 1 Ranger, Barbarian

   There are two kinds of disarm.  Disarming weapons and disarming traps.
   If one types "disarm monstername", then, if the player has the disarm
   weapon skill, and successfully uses it, the monster's weapon will fly
   from its hand/tentacle, etc.      If one types "disarm trapname", if
   the player has the disarm traps skill, one can attempt to disable the
   trap.. failure indicates a high probability that the trap will be sprung

   the spell.  Dropping link may also interfere with  the action
   of the spell.  NOTE:  This only restores total experience.
   Drain does not always remove  experience, it always removes
   levels.  For instance:  Say Warrior was level 22, with
   4,000,000 experience, and he died.  He is  still level 22,
   but only has 2,000,000 exp now.  He kills things for a while,
   and gains some exp back up to 3,000,000 experience.  (This
   would be enough experience for level 18.)  At this point he
   gets drained two  levels to level 20.  He STILL HAS THE
   3,000,000 exp!  He lost no  experience, so energy restore will
   do nothing.  He is now level 20 with  exp for 18, instead of
   level 22 with exp for 18.

    Accumulative: -
    Duration    : Instantaneous
    Level       : Level 36 cleric.
    Save        : None

   With this spell the cleric calls upon the aid of their deity
   to bring the  life force back into a dead person.  This is quite
   an undertaking as it will  require a sacrifice of 25,000 coins for
   mobs and 75,000 coins for PC's, and the beneficiary loses 1 con point
   permanently..after the con reaches 3, no more resurrections can occur.
   The calling of such help from a deity is so  draining on the cleric
   that the cleric will move to 1 hit point, 1 mana, and  1 movement point,
   also they will be stunned for a while.  Make sure you are  in a safe
   place before casting or else you might end up with the same fate as
   your victim.  If this spell is cast upon a monster the monster becomes a
   loyal  follower of the cast for 36 game hours.   IMPORTANT:  The dead
   character has to stay OUT of the game until 	he/she is resurrected.
   If he/she reenters the game, he/she 	cannot be resurrected.  All the way out.
   I.E. all the way out of 	telnet.  If you are at the choice menu,
   tough luck - you were  warned!

   Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other

   things by yourself. The useful aspect of thieves involves their

   traps and selling and buying items at the black market.  You can
   improve your skills by using the practice command.

  allowed to set a title. Most everything will be allowed, as long as it
  is not insulting to anyone, and does not contain profanities.
  Colors are possible, however players are requested to avoid color bleeding
  (this is easily remedied by resetting the collor to *c0007 after the title)
  Also note that it is possible to have one word before your name, for example
  your title could be: Lady Lennya, Daughter of the Winds
  Ex: title Lady Lennya, Daughter of the Winds

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

    Use : Use <Staff>
        : Use <Wand> <Target>

   Using staves will automatically target everybody (or everything)
   in a room, in some cases, or everyone not in your group in others.
   Therefore staves are naturally very powerful, and yet may be very
   dangerous to use around other players.  Using wands require that
   you point it at a target, which can be either a character or an
   object.   Both staves and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to
   use! (Use the grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name
   of the staff or wand to avoid confusion.

WARRIOR FIGHTER

   Warriors are known to have more strength than the average
   player. This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as
   they possess skills of violence and fighting unequaled by
   the members of any other class. However, they lack the
   ability to use magic of any sort.  You can improve your
   skills by using the practice command, in the room in the
   swordspeople's guild with the guildmaster (usually the last
   room)

WINGS

   Avariel and a few other races have wings on their backs.
   Avariel in particular have large feathered wings that are
   vulnerable to fire. Wings only allow you to fly for an amount
   of time based heavily on your Constitution. Afterwards you must
   rest for a period of time, also based on Constitution, or have
   a refresh or second wind spell cast on you.  Wings may be burnt
   by fire spells, in which case the unfortunate victim starts to
   fall. They have enough control to find a close landing spot,
   but could be in trouble if they take a hit high in the air.
   Surviving Avariel can have a heal spell cast to quickly regenerate
   their burned wings, although they will naturally heal in time.
