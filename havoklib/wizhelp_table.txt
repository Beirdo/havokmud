EMPTY SLOT
#
"ROOM TELEPORT"
 
some new things for teleport rooms:
 
 
edit tele <time> <room> <flags> [<countdown>]
 
flags = 
1     LOOK    (do a look when you get teleported
2     COUNT   (this is a countdown room)
4     RANDOM  (after the first teleport, this room will teleport in random
		time)
8     SPIN    (Not implemented yet)
 
 
Some things to note:
 
 if you are going to set the COUNT flag, then leave the <time> = 0
 
 COUNT, RANDOM and SPIN are more or less mutually exclusive.
 
 
examples
 
   edit tele 30 1000 1       ;  teleport fires every 30 ticks, goes to room
			        1000, does a look
 
   edit tele  0 1000 3 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and
				they will do a look.
 
   edit tele  0 1000 2 30    ; 30 ticks after a player enters this room,
				they will be teleported to room 1000, and they
				will NOT do a look
 
Any questions, post them on the board
 
The random time will be between 10 and 100 ticks
 
(so roughly between 7.5 seconds and 75 seconds)
 
Note, this is a god command, mortals can't do it.

can save your changes into a file, and reload them later into the
game, (if it crashes, for example).

 edit <field> <attributes>
 
   field is one of the following:
 
	name     :  changes the name of the room.
	desc     :  changes the room description.

	fs       :  changes the Flags, and Sector type.
	exdsc    :  adds, changes or deletes an exit description
	extra    :  adds an extra description to a room.
	riv      :  adds special parameters for rivers.
	tele     :  makes the room a teleport room.
        tunn     :  makes the room a tunnel room.
 
   attributes:

	exit  <dir> <door flags> <key> <to_room> [<open command>]
	fs    <flags> <sector_type>
	exdsc <dir> <enter>  (prompts you for text)
	extra <keywords> <enter>  (prompts you for text)
	riv   <speed> <dir>
        tele  <time> <to_room> <look-flag>
        tunn  <mob_lim>
 
<dir>  0 = n, 1 = e, 2 = s, 3 = w, 4 = u, 5= d.

        'S' - secret flag
        'C' - climb

            time they are teleported, they are forced to look.

RULES

     *******Immortal Code of Conduct*******

As immortals, our job is to not only oversee the running of the mud, but to
make it a fun place for everyone, mortals and immortals.  All of us have played
in muds in which both mortals, and surprisingly immortals, have insulted
players, tried to cheat, steal, or lie to one another.  (unnamed yet) was not
created to be just another mud.  It was created with the idea that mortals and
immortals would treat each other with respect so that it would be a fun place
for everyone.  Since there is no way to screen every person who immorts, it
is necessary for us to have a code of conduct for immortals.

It goes as follows:

1. Please do not swear over public channels.  It gives immortals a bad name,
   and it's also rude.

2. Please do not misuse your powers in a way that would hurt any other
   character.

3. Please do not tolerate the swearing of any players, whether mortal or
   immortal.  If a player is caught swearing over public channels, give them
   warning that they are breaking the rules, and, if swearing persists,
   despite warnings, disconnect the player.

4. Please do not insult other players.  We want this mud to be one where
   everyone feels welcome.  If two players have a disagreement, they can settle
   it between themselves.  No public channels are to be used to exchange
   insults.

5. Please do not share untrue information with newbies.  For example, when they
   ask for directions somewhere, do not give them directions to a death trap.

6. Respect all immortals, especially ones higher then you.

7. Respect all mortals, even newbies.  They may not be as good a player as you,
   but they still deserve respect.

8. Do not threaten anyone with character deletion for reasons other then
   repetitive breaking of (unnamed yet) rules.

9. Please discuss all major decisions with one or more of the implementors:
   Pentak, Xenon, or Tsaron.

10. If you have any problems with any immortal, explain the situation to an
    implementor and they will decide what should be done.  Do not take the
    punishment of anyone into your own hands.

Failure to comply with this code of conduct will result in restricted use of
your immortal character, and ultimately deletion of your character if bad
conduct continues.  We take these rules seriously, and as immortals, our job is
to be good examples to mortals so that all will, if not get along, try to
tolerate each other.

INFO

As immortals, we basically know everything that goes on in the MUD.  Some of
this information may be imparted to players, but other information is not
appropriate to share with anyone.  In light of the fact that as immortals,
we may or may not know what we're allowed to tell players, this list of
rules has been made for your convenience.  Please do not share any of the
following information with any player:

1. Locations of zones not finished yet.  If a player ends up in a zone that
   isn't finished yet, a lot of problems could arise.  So just to be on the
   safe side, don't transfer players to an unfinished zone or tell them how
   to get there.

2. Locations of the best equipment in the game.  The object of the game is
   to allow players to explore the mud themselves, and find their own EQ
   and experience points.  If an immortal helps a player by locating EQ and
   mobs, it defeats the purpose of the game, and also shows favoritism.

3. Anything deemed by any other immortal as "secret" or "private" or
   anything else along that line.  The times of any arenas or quests that
   might be held, as well as what will be expected of the player on a quest
   are all things that would give a player an unfair advantage over those
   who wouldn't know this information.

Also, please do not do any of the following for a mortal, unless
specifically allowed to do so by a higher immortal:

1. Do not restring or re-edit a piece of equipment to the player's advantage
   unless the player has won the restring somehow.  Also, do not change the
   stats of equipment for a player's benefit.  Again, this would be showing
   favoritism.  It would also seem very strange for a mortal to be wearing a
   piece of equipment that would give him/her 1000 extra hit points.

2. Do not give maps of certain zones or areas to mortals.  They are supposed
   to explore and find out things by themselves.  At some times, locations
   of DT's MAY be imparted, however, it's best not to give any information
   regarding this topic.

3. Do not become the group leader of any group, allowing yourself to find,
   go to, or help kill mobs and get experience points or equipment for
   anything else along that line.  The times of any arenas or quests that
   might be held, as well as what will be expected of the player on a quest
   are all things that would give a player an unfair advantage over those
   who wouldn't know this information.

Also, please do not do any of the following for a mortal, unless
specifically allowed to do so by a higher immortal:

1. Do not restring or re-edit a piece of equipment to the player's advantage
   unless the player has won the restring somehow.  Also, do not change the
   stats of equipment for a player's benefit.  Again, this would be showing
   favoritism.  It would also seem very strange for a mortal to be wearing a
   piece of equipment that would give him/her 1000 extra hit points.

2. Do not give maps of certain zones or areas to mortals.  They are supposed
   to explore and find out things by themselves.  At some times, locations
   of DT's MAY be imparted, however, it's best not to give any information
   regarding this topic.

3. Do not become the group leader of any group, allowing yourself to find,
   go to, or help kill mobs and get experience points or equipment for 
   players.  Do not join any mortal groups unless otherwise instructed by
   a higher immortal.

These rules are designed to keep immortality the enigma and honor that it
is.  Once a player has immorted, they have deserved the right to some of
these things, as well as the information that perhaps they hadn't known
before.  Just keep these things in mind when mortals are asking you
questions.  If you don't know whether or not to impart certain information,
use your good judgement.  That is, for those of you who HAVE good judgement.
For the rest of you, ask someone, or tell the mortal that you're simply not
allowed to give out that kind of information.
